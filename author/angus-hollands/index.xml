While this usually isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal, it means that there is a missed opportunity to grow the impact of an ecosystem because it requires coordinated development among multiple stakeholders within it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of the reasons we created 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s open community hub platform. By deploying a single platform that utilizes entirely open infrastructure that we contribute back to, we have visibility over a variety of projects along with the need to combine them together for a specific end-user outcome. One-such development scenario recently came up involving
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Allowing readers to &amp;ldquo;bring their own Binders&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#allowing-readers-to-bring-their-own-binders">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working to integrate
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> workflows with our community hubs for a more seamless experience (for example, having book pages link back to interactive cloud sessions that allow users to interact with the content). We imagine a network of Jupyter Books that all build upon the same core infrastructures (JupyterHub, Binder, etc) for cloud-based computing. Our hope is to allow a user to &lt;em>bring their own Binder&lt;/em> with them so that they can interact with another book&amp;rsquo;s content with their own cloud infrastructure. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A student with access to &lt;code>binder.myuniversity.edu&lt;/code> could read a Jupyter Book created by a professor at &lt;code>otheruniversity.edu&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Jupyter Book is defined with a
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder specification&lt;/a> that has a recipe for re-building the environment needed to run te book&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the professor&amp;rsquo;s book, the student can choose to launch an interactive Binder sessions on &lt;em>their university&amp;rsquo;s Binder&lt;/em>, allowing them to interact with the book&amp;rsquo;s content on their own infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We want a workflow like this to be as seamless and un-complicated as possible. We also want it to follow the same fundamental workflow as the
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/community/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller-based launch buttons&lt;/a>. Along the way, we realized that we needed to coordinate development across
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a>],
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Getting Jupyter Book to discover Jupyter Hub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-jupyter-book-to-discover-jupyter-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As we began developing this workflow, we realized that there was a blocker in the JupyterHub and BinderHub ecosystem that needed to be fixed. We needed a way to &lt;strong>ask a JupyterHub whether it had an unauthenticated end-point for service discovery&lt;/strong>. Basically, a way to ask a hub &amp;ldquo;what kind of hub are you, and how can we launch an interactive session on you?&amp;rdquo; Doing this is simple-enough - JupyterHub already has a way of reporting its version and application type, which allows us to infer how to launch interactive sessions. But, we hit a snag in an HTML context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, JupyterHub disallows certain kinds of
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&lt;/a> (CORS) requests, in order to restrict other applications from abusing a JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API. If you hit parts of a JupyterHub API from &lt;em>the command line&lt;/em>, things work fine. But if you do the same thing via JavaScript from a website, the request is disallowed. This was a problem if we want Jupyter Book (a web application) to be able to make requests of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we realized that we needed to make an &lt;strong>upstream contribution in JupyterHub&lt;/strong> in order to &lt;strong>enable an interaction between JupyterHub and Jupyter Book&lt;/strong>. In this case, it was a relatively simple fix: allowing CORS requests for the specific API endpoint we needed (which is a very lightweight endpoint that is not vulnerable to security risks, and is broadly useful to make accessible)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. That resulted in two PRs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4966" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/jupyterhub#4966&lt;/a> allows CORS requests for the API that was needed for service discovery in JupyterHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/binderhub#1906&lt;/a> enables this workflow on a BinderHub so that its services can be discovered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/pull/503" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyter-book/myst-theme#503&lt;/a> adds new launch button functionality to
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> that allows readers to bring their own Binder / JupyterHub links for launching. (this is what necessitated the above two PRs)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a result of this upstream contribution loop, JupyterHub can now accept API requests at its &amp;ldquo;service discovery&amp;rdquo; endpoint, which means that Jupyter Book (and any other web application) can more easily learn about a hub&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to share this short vignette because it&amp;rsquo;s a good reflection of the kind of value that 2i2c tries to provide, given its role in helping to build and enhance networks of infrastructure, domain communities, and open source communities. In this case, we enabled a &lt;em>cross-project&lt;/em> workflow that required knowledge of each project, and a vision for how they could be used together in a way that exceeded the sum of their parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more potential in these kinds of workflows, and are eager to continue our work to identify and enhance community-centric infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>This actually required an interesting bit of team discussion that was much easier with a few 2i2c staff on the JupyterHub team. The original request from Angus was interpreted as opening up the &lt;em>entire hub API&lt;/em> to external requests (which is a bad idea!) but we were able to quickly discuss this with the JupyterHub team to clarify that this was only about a very specific API endpoint. This is the kind of communication loop that often goes haywire when you have people contributing to a project without historical relationships to the project&amp;rsquo;s maintainers.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Chris led a mini-hackathon to introduce the group to MyST and collect feedback on where enhancement features could be made in the future. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the outcomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many improvements were made to the
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST documentation&lt;/a> 📖
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST Quick Start Guide&lt;/a> was used to onboard new users. Amendments were
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/1433" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >upstreamed to the MyST docs directly&lt;/a> and were immediately available to all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-executable-documents" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tutorial on executable documents&lt;/a> was added to the collection of MyST tutorials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MyST-MD installation instructions were
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/1454" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >simplified using &lt;code>mamba&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A bunch of enhancement features were requested ✨
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1455" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Using cell tags for labelling notebook cells&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/321" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Support for loading user-defined CSS stylesheets for theming&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hackathons are a great way for quickly imparting knowledge and gathering feedback in a short space of time. The event spurred rapid contributions to the MyST ecosystem – embracing reuse of the MyST quick start guides saved time and effort, while engaging with users directly closed a tight feedback loop for enhancements.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a>, a community platform for Big Data geoscience in which 2i2c operates a cloud hub. The core aim of Project Pythia is to spearhead the creation and curation of community-driven, open-source documentation, in the form of &amp;ldquo;cookbooks&amp;rdquo;, to enable the adoption of &lt;em>open&lt;/em>, &lt;em>scalable&lt;/em> and &lt;em>reproducible&lt;/em> workflows for geoscientists.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/pythia-cookoff-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia Cook-off 2024&lt;/a>, a hackathon where cookbook authors and collaborators can spend dedicated time on creating and maintaining their content using

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c deployed and demonstrated a dedicated BinderHub service for Project Pythia that allowed hackathon participants to &amp;ldquo;self-serve&amp;rdquo; images of their software environment, which were specified by including a list of packages in an &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> file placed in their GitHub cookbook repository. Participants could then pull the image from a container registry into their 2i2c hub (or indeed, any other JupyterHub server) to share and reproduce their computational environments with ease.&lt;/p>

Day 2
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>During the first half of the day, we quickly identified a number of issues that were proving to be a maintenance headache for the Project Pythia infrastructure group:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Configuration files for each cookbook were difficult to update at scale. Project Pythia currently have a gallery of over 30 cookbooks!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Changes to Sphinx-based themes inherited from upstream were prone to breaking custom Project Pythia branding downstream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Executable content was not able to run on the Project Pythia&amp;rsquo;s dedicated BinderHub hosted on
&lt;a href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JetStream2&lt;/a> (operated by NSF).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Cookbooks frequently cross-referenced materials from other cookbooks to build upon pre-existing knowledge, but this was not easy to author and the reader experience was not as smooth as it could be.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Following the announcement that
&lt;a href="" >Jupyter Book 2.0 will use MyST&lt;/a> last month, Rowan (Curvenote) and Angus (2i2c) delivered a compelling demonstration of the
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST&lt;/a> ecosystem centered around modern web-first technologies (JavaScript/TypeScript) that offers improved interactivity and accessibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the second half of the day, we decided to use the hackathon to explore migrating the Pythia cookbooks from using a Sphinx-based to a MyST-based document structure and engine. Within one afternoon, the group migrated four cookbooks to use MyST MD&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This moment was palpably exciting! It was evident that MyST MD supported backwards compatible content out of the box, which alleviated fears of sunk cost into existing Sphinx-based cookbooks. The migration workflow was as simple as executing the following commands&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>conda install mystmd&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>myst&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

Day 4
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Looking to the future, we spent time reflecting on our experiences and discussing the potential, transformative impact MyST MD tooling could have in the hands of the scientific community at large, including the communities served by 2i2c. Knowledge-sharing based on static figures and PDFs would fall obsolete and give way to a dynamic, web-first approach to sharing interactive narratives backed by compute from a Jupyter server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout the course of the hackathon, the rate of iterated development for both end users of the community cookbook and the developers of the open-source tooling was astounding. For example, we were able to quickly expose small bugs (
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd/issues/1297" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >e.g. support for HTML video tags&lt;/a>) in the MyST MD tooling, which were immediately fixed upstream and released within minutes. The feedback loop that connected the user experience with the software tooling was incredibly synergistic, with immediate impact both upstream and downstream that 2i2c hopes to continue replicating across many facets of their operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the Project Pythia Cook-off, the breakout group will continue conversations around strengthening their community of practice and hopefully advocating for wider adoption of MyST MD amongst the scientific community (say hello to some of our group members at
&lt;a href="https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >SciPy 2024&lt;/a> in July!).&lt;/p>
