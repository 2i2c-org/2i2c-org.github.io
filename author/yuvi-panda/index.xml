&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/open-technology/" >Commitment to Open Technology&lt;/a>. It is focused on &lt;em>software licenses&lt;/em> for reasons we&amp;rsquo;ll describe below. We hope that it clarifies what kind of licenses we&amp;rsquo;ll use, and assures our communities that we will not change our stance towards open source technology in the future. This ensures 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s long-term commitment to community-owned and open infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a platform and service provider gives us a lot of power, and also introduces a potential source of &lt;em>lock-in&lt;/em> for our member communities. While 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational mission and culture are strongly aligned with open infrastructure, we believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to encode commitments like these in a formal way to provide both transparency and accountability to our member communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-commitment-to-open-technology">
Our commitment to open technology
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-commitment-to-open-technology">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Below we copy the original language of this policy from our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/open-technology/" >Commitment to Open Technology&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- TODO: When we switch to MyST, we should embed this rather than copy/paste -->
&lt;p>&lt;em>Definitions of MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY, etc are defined in
&lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >RFC 2119&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>All engineering artifacts (code, documentation, etc) produced by 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineering team MUST be licensed under an open source license approved by a non-profit organization that is not 2i2c.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Source Projects originating at 2i2c, or stewarded by 2i2c, MUST NOT require a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Contributor Licensing Agreement&lt;/a> that includes Copyright Assignment to 2i2c.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The list of external organizations that define licenses we accept are
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://opensource.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Open Source Initiative&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>the
&lt;a href="https://ethicalsource.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Organization for Ethical Source&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modifying (1), (2), or (3) MUST be done through a 2/3 majority vote of 2i2c staff.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-commitment-mean">
What does this commitment mean?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-this-commitment-mean">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In plain language, here&amp;rsquo;s what this commitment means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll only use open source licenses that have been approved by standard non-profits that are broadly recognized by the tech industry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For anything we build, we won&amp;rsquo;t require contributors to give up the rights to their contributions via CLAs, so that it is much harder for 2i2c to change our licenses in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changing this policy will require organization-wide agreement, and in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll give authority over this policy to a group of people representing our member communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="why-are-licenses-and-clas-important">
Why are licenses and CLAs important?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-are-licenses-and-clas-important">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Many organizations claim to be committed to open infrastructure, while retaining the ability to &lt;em>change this commitment in the future when it is in their interests&lt;/em>. A classic example of this is a &amp;ldquo;bait and switch&amp;rdquo; that looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A company releases software under an open source license and professes to build an open source community around it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, they retain the rights to all of the code in their projects through a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a> (CLA) with copyright assignment. This generally means that contributors must &lt;em>give up the rights to their contribution&lt;/em> in order to make that contribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once their product has gained traction and it is in their interests, the company can &lt;em>change the license&lt;/em> to whatever they wish (even one that is not open source) because they retain the rights to all contributions in the codebase.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They then leverage this new position as owners of a proprietary project to extract business value or grow their position in a market.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Think this sounds unlikely? Here are just a few recent examples of companies that have switched their license after many years of releasing their technology under an open source license:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Redis&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hashicorp / Terraform&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch#Licensing_changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Elastic Search&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We want to ensure our communities that 2i2c is not headed down this path, in order to give them confidence in treating us as a long-term service partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-change-about-2i2cs-open-source-commitment">
What does this change about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s open source commitment?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-this-change-about-2i2cs-open-source-commitment">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In short: nothing. These are already the principles that 2i2c was committed to from its inception, and already implied via our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a>. However, we wanted to make these commitments more formally in order to give ourselves more accountability to sticking with them, and to provide more transparency for our community members and stakeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="who-is-this-for">
Who is this for?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#who-is-this-for">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We imagine three audiences for this policy:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>2i2c present and future staff&lt;/strong> who want to ensure that their organization remains committed to our open principles. This document provides a sense of psychological safety to have bold discussions about structuring our approach to open source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Member communities and 2i2c stakeholders&lt;/strong> who need to have an understanding of the guarantees that we provide in order to trust 2i2c as a service developer and provider. This is similar to the effect our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a> has.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source communities&lt;/strong> who need to understand our long-term commitment and goals around open technology in order to trust as a peer and collaborator within open source communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="wed-love-feedback">
We&amp;rsquo;d love feedback
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#wed-love-feedback">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We hope that these ideas both clarify our intent and the reason that we think it&amp;rsquo;s important. We&amp;rsquo;d love feedback about early refinements to these principles in order to make them more effective, as well as ways that we can provide more community oversight and participation in evolving these policies moving forward.

&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-home-nfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/a> is a young project to provide flexible per-user home directory limits on JupyterHub - an important feature for controlling cloud costs.
&lt;a href="https://sunu.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Tarashish Mishra&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://sgibson91.github.io/cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sarah Gibson&lt;/a> have been leading this project for the last few months. Since we are moving away from
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >AWS Managed EFS&lt;/a> here, we had to do some work to recreate some of the benefits EFS gives us out of the box. During this quarter, we:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Set up automated backups so we can recover files in cases of disaster&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up automated alerting (via prometheus and pagerduty) to know if our backing EBS device is getting full and we need to perform a manual intervention&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployed this to a few other communities (
&lt;a href="https://www.cryocloud.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NMFS Openscapes&lt;/a>) to broaden adoption.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We will continue doing work on &lt;code>jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/code> in the upcoming quarter! If this is functionality you are interested in deploying, please reach out to us to collaborate!&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-jupyterhub/issues/58" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Tracking Issue&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We covered this more extensively in
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles-rollout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >another blog post&lt;/a>, so go read that!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This work in particular is a good demonstrator of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s value - it started off with a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >grant from GESIS&lt;/a>, and now with support from
&lt;a href="https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA IMPACT&lt;/a> we are able to bring it to a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of communities, not just the ones that funded it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ongoing work here will focus on improving the UX as well as better documentation so users can actually use it!&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-jupyterhub/issues/59" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Tracking Issue&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had worked in the past with many communities in enabling
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/qgis-greenland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGIS on the Cloud&lt;/a>, and this quarter we got closer to enabling a contextual &amp;lsquo;Open in QGIS&amp;rsquo; button in the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >VEDA Dashboard&lt;/a>! Here is a quick demo:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./open-in-qgis.mp4" muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(This shows the workflow when user is already logged into the JupyterHub and had started the server)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can play with this in
&lt;a href="https://deploy-preview-688--ghg-demo.netlify.app/exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this preview&lt;/a>, although you need to have access to the NASA VEDA hub to fully try it out at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tarashish from Development Seed is again responsible for most of the work here, available in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunu/jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy&lt;/a>. You can use it to create &amp;lsquo;magic links&amp;rsquo; that will open QGIS in a desktop environment in your browser, and add a specific layer to it! Our hope is that this allows primarily GIS folks to better use tools they already are familiar with in cloud based contexts.&lt;/p>

In Kubernetes based JupyterHub environments, a
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/latest/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#using-multiple-profiles-to-let-users-select-their-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >profile list&lt;/a> provides this functionality.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
(Profile List for the NASA VEDA JupyterHub with the default implementation from KubeSpawner)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The profile list is the de-facto &amp;ldquo;logged in homepage&amp;rdquo; for these users, as that is what they see after they have logged in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a>, funded by our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >earlier grant&lt;/a> from
&lt;a href="https://www.gesis.org/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GESIS&lt;/a> as well as the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA project&lt;/a>, we have been building the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>&lt;/a> project to improve this experience.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
(Profile List for the NASA VEDA JupyterHub with &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, we rolled this new experience out to all 2i2c managed JupyterHubs! Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick rundown of what this enables:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Descriptions for choices in the dropdowns, making it much easier for users to know what they are getting with each environment (or resource selection).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fully backwards compatible with the existing KubeSpawner profile list implementation. In our PR to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/5083" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >roll this out&lt;/a> to all hubs, you notice that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to change the structure of any profile lists! So you can safely roll this out to your hubs too without needing to fundamentally change how your profiles are set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is a modern web app (built with
&lt;a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >react&lt;/a>), just like the JupyterHub admin panel. This allows us to evolve and satisfy user needs much faster, as well as expanding the pool of people who can contribute to the project!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support for dynamically building images using
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> style repositories! It talks to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >binderhub&lt;/a> API so users can build reproducible environments as they wish without admin involvement nor needing to fully understand how docker and containers work. Our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >earlier blog post&lt;/a> has more information.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is just the start, and thanks to ongoing funding from the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA&lt;/a> project, we are going to continue making improvements to this experience.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2i2c team are proud to continue our strong working collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a>, following our previous work on launching the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/" >US GHG center&lt;/a> (also see the
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/blog/2023-12-14-ghg-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed blog post&lt;/a>). Together with scientists at NASA in our regular sync touchpoints, we have recently delivered a tranche of improvements to
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This platform is designed to thread open-source components together to consolidate GIS delivery mechanisms, processing, analysis and visualization tools, and presented in a collaborative interactive computing environment. All code repositories and associated resources stemming from this work are available on the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/VEDA/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >VEDA GitHub page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the spirit of fully open development, you can

the combined 2i2c and Development Seed team had for the last quarter. In this blog post, we will describe some of the significant ones!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-image-management-and-testing">
Better image management and testing
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#better-image-management-and-testing">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker-action&lt;/a> is a GitHub action simplifying image building and testing for use with JupyterHub, using either a &lt;code>Dockerfile&lt;/code> or various
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration files&lt;/a> (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code>, &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>, etc) supported by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>. We migrated our image building pipeline from a somewhat homegrown solution to this upstream action, making image updates and testing &lt;em>much&lt;/em> easier. In particular, we can
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pangeo-notebook-veda-image/pull/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >automatically run test notebooks&lt;/a> on every change we make to the image! This way, we can easily catch any breaking changes in library versions or other package installs without disrupting users. We also debugged and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action/pull/124" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >contributed upstream&lt;/a> fixes to the testing infrastructure so everyone could benefit from this, rather than just us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">
Automatically pulling example notebooks on startup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When a user logs into a JupyterHub, it is very helpful if we could have a bunch of example notebooks and other content pre-populated for them so they can get started right away.
&lt;a href="https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> is heavily used for this particular use case. However, it requires that nbgitpuller is installed inside the image the user is using - and not all images have it installed. In particular, we wanted to continue using the (wonderful)
&lt;a href="https://rocker-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Rocker images&lt;/a> maintained upstream for R users, however they do not have nbgitpuller installed. To solve this problem we built
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/jupyterhub-gitpuller-init" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-gitpuller-init&lt;/a>, which can be used as an
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >init container&lt;/a> to pre-populate user content on persistent home directories regardless of the image used. We also made sure to build this in a way that &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> can use it, and it is not tied into either 2i2c or VEDA infrastructure!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="opening-specific-visualizations-in-qgis-via-url">
Opening specific visualizations in QGIS via URL
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#opening-specific-visualizations-in-qgis-via-url">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.qgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGIS&lt;/a> is the world&amp;rsquo;s most used open source GIS software, and previously 2i2c had
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/desktop-gis-software-in-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-ddced297019a" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >worked with Openscapes and QGreenland&lt;/a> to bring this &lt;em>desktop&lt;/em> software to JupyterHub. We had previously worked on a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/nasa-qgis-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >container image&lt;/a> that allows users to access large datasets stored in the cloud directly through QGIS on the JupyterHub, allowing users to work with much larger datasets than they could on their desktops by bringing cloud compute adjacent to the data. As a continuation of this work, we developed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunu/jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy&lt;/a>, which builds QGIS specific features on top of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy&lt;/a>. In particular, it allows creation of shareable links that when clicked, opens specific datasets and layers in QGIS in a JupyterHub! You can see this in action:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This opens up exciting future possibilities. Imagine this
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/data-catalog/campfire_ndvi_difference_2015_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >exploration of the Camp Fire&lt;/a> having an &amp;lsquo;Open in QGIS&amp;rsquo; button that enables further exploration of the data without the user needing to download or install anything! Work will continue in the coming quarter towards achieving this vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are also excited to see recent work in this space
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/jupytergis-d63b7adf9d0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >from QuantStack and Simula Labs&lt;/a>, and will follow up to ensure an orderly transition to more web native workflows for existing users of QGIS in due time.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a continuation of our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" >GESIS collaboration&lt;/a>. In the path to deploying dynamic image building to end users, we wanted to stabilize
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/a> enough to deploy to users of VEDA (and eventually everyone else). This is the primary interface users see &lt;em>after&lt;/em> they log in to JupyterHub, and was ripe for UX improvements. The default interface looks like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Working closely with the 2i2c team on growing features to support users on the VEDA and GHG Center hubs has been absolutely amazing. With 2i2c’s deep experience in the Jupyter ecosystem, we have been able to implement some fairly complex features quite easily, and their strong open-source roots have ensured that whatever we work on is broadly useful to the wider Jupyter and scientific computing communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://openscapes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Openscapes&lt;/a> is a value-based initiative that supports kinder, better science based on open source community.
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA Openscapes&lt;/a> is in its fourth year as a project supporting NASA Earth science in the Cloud, co-developed by Julia Lowndes (Openscapes) and Erin Robinson (Metadata Game Changers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initiative recently supported the
&lt;a href="https://nasa.github.io/VITALS/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Surface Biology and Geology: VITALS Workshop&lt;/a> hosted by NASA
&lt;a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Land Processes Distributed Activate Archive Center (LP DAAC)&lt;/a> and NASA
&lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructors used the 2i2c Openscapes Hub to lead hands-on exercises teaching learners how to manipulate data collected from the
&lt;a href="https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ECOSTRESS&lt;/a> and

&lt;p>This event was attended by around 250 participants. An event of this size therefore requires a &lt;em>frictionless login flow&lt;/em> so that organizers could focus on the essential complexity of teaching data analysis rather than the accidental complexity of managing Hub authorization. GitHub authentication is the default option for most 2i2c Hubs for research use cases, but for an educational event of this size this option was not fit for purpose since organizers had to&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Retrieve the GitHub usernames of each participant (assuming everyone was familiar with GitHub!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually invite GitHub users to a GitHub organization to authorize access to the Hub (invitations would expire within seven days)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repeat the above two steps last-minute for participants who showed up on the day without preparing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually remove GitHub users from the GitHub organization if they wanted to revoke access to the Hub after the event.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In response to this need, we developed a shared password feature so that workshop organizers can simply hand the share password out to learners for access to the Hub. This bypassed the manual labour of managing GitHub accounts while not adding to the learner&amp;rsquo;s high cognitive load and improving the participant&amp;rsquo;s learning experience overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the elements that enabled us to recognize and solve this issue effectively is our close partnership with the Openscapes team. We engage in regular
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2i2cAccessPolicies/issues/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >6-weekly catch-ups&lt;/a> where we can learn about user requirements and how we can develop our infrastructure to co-create optimal solutions. Together with our
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/product/deliveryflow/#defining-our-product-delivery-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Product Delivery Flow&lt;/a>, we were quickly able to architect the shared password solution in time for the workshop.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Spyglass&lt;/a> is a framework for reproducible and shareable neuroscience research produced by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/LorenFrankLab" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Loren Frank’s lab&lt;/a> at the University of California, San Francisco. Check out our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/hhmi-spyglass/" >blog post about the release of their preprint&lt;/a> to read more about the methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post focuses on the complex data storage needed for the project, which can be difficult to set up locally or at scale in the cloud. In particular, the analysis needed a MySQL database for reproducibility. This is a fairly common task across many fields. The aim of 2i2c is to enable researchers to focus on the essential complexity of what they were doing, i.e. the science, without managing the accidental complexity of how to do it &amp;ndash; in this case, setting up databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We describe how you can do this too for your own JupyterHubs. Since 2i2c commits to running our infrastructure in line with open-source values as much as possible, you can also directly see the

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sidecar containers are the secondary containers that run along with the main application container within the same Pod. These containers are used to enhance or to extend the functionality of the primary app container by providing additional services, or functionality such as logging, monitoring, security, or data synchronization, without directly altering the primary application code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In this case, the &lt;em>primary&lt;/em> app container is the JupyterLab instance where people are interactively running code and doing science. We want to provide a MySQL database as a sidecar so that each user server gets their own independent MySQL server instance (that is not accessible to anyone else). We can then run code such as&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">%%bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root --password=tutorial &amp;lt; path-to-sql-file-with-data
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>to load data into the database. Note the IP address &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code> - the MySQL server is listening on localhost, even though it is not running in the &lt;em>same container&lt;/em>! Thanks to the magic of
&lt;a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/580893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Linux Network Namespaces&lt;/a>, the sidecar and main app container can share &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code>. This allows you to write code that works &lt;strong>in the exact same way&lt;/strong> on a user&amp;rsquo;s local computers as on the JupyterHub, making transitions and replication easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> is a very popular service that allows end users to specify and share the environment (languages, packages, etc) required for their notebooks to run correctly by placing
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#config-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration files&lt;/a> they are already familiar with (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> or &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>) along with their notebooks. While not without its own set of challenges, this is extremely powerful because it puts control of the &lt;em>environment&lt;/em> in the hands of the people who write the code. They can customize the environment to fit the needs of their code, instead of having to fit their code into the environment that admins have made available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, mybinder.org (and the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a> software that powers it) is built for &lt;em>sharing&lt;/em> your work after you are done with it, &lt;em>not&lt;/em> for actively doing work. BinderHubs often do not have persistent storage nor persistent user identity, and UX is centered around &lt;em>ephemeral&lt;/em> interactivity that can be shared with others (via a link), rather than &lt;em>persistent&lt;/em> interactivity that a single user repeatedly comes back to.
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a> is more commonly used for this kinda workflow, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently have the ability for users to easily build their own environments. Admins who are &lt;em>running&lt;/em> the JupyterHub can make
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#using-multiple-profiles-to-let-users-select-their-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >multiple environments&lt;/a> available for users to choose from, but this still puts admins in the critical path for environment customization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/gesis-2i2c-collaboration-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >collaboration&lt;/a> with
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GESIS&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NFDI4DS&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CESSDA&lt;/a>, aims to bring this flexibility to JupyterHub directly. We aim to empower users to decide for themselves which applications and dependencies are installed on a per-project basis. Our work enables communities with heterogeneous requirements to share a single Hub. Our approach frees administrators from being overwhelmed by installation requests and transforms the JupyterHub platform into a platform for collaborative computational reproducibility. In this update, we report on our progress and upcoming steps in this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">
What does a BinderHub do, exactly?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is helpful to understand that BinderHub primarily has 3 responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Present a UI to the end user for them to provide details on what to build (this is what you see when you go to mybinder.org)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call out to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a> in a scalable way to actually &lt;em>build and push&lt;/em> an image containing the environment for the given repository, and show the user logs as this build process happens. This also allows users to debug issues with their build more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk to a JupyterHub instance to launch a user server with the built docker image, and redirect the user to this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>(2) is really the &lt;em>core&lt;/em> feature of BinderHub, and we settled on figuring out how to make that available to JupyterHub users. It was really important to us that this was also done in a way that can be sustainably used by &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em>, not just 2i2c. This blog post discusses the various improvements to the broad ecosystem of projects in the Jupyter ecosystem to get this done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demo">
Demo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#demo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But first, a very quick demo of how this looks like right now now!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- generated from original .mov screen recording with `ffmpeg -i screencast.mov -c:v libx264 screencast.mp4` -->
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./screencast.mp4" autoplay muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very much a work in progress, but the basic flow can be seen clearly. Users see a Server Options menu after they log into JupyterHub. They can specify the two primary things that determine the server configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The resources allocated (RAM, CPU and maybe GPU)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The environment (container image) used, which can be specified in one of 3 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. A pre-selected list of environments (container images), provided by the administrators who set up this JupyterHub
b. A blank text box where you can enter any publicly available docker image they want
c. A mybinder.org style way to specify a GitHub repository, which will be then dynamically built into a docker image for the user!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what did we need to do to accomplish this, in a way that&amp;rsquo;s very upstream friendly and usable by everyone (and not just 2i2c)?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">
A Standalone &lt;code>binderhub-service&lt;/code> helm chart
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The default upstream
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/tree/main/helm-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a> &lt;em>includes&lt;/em> a JupyterHub as a dependency, and configures itself to be used primarily in a manner similar to
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a>. As the person who helped make that choice early on, I can tell you why it was made - for convenience! And it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> very convenient, as it allowed us to get mybinder.org going fast. However, it makes it difficult to install a BinderHub service &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub. To this end, we have created a standalone
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/binderhub-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a>, designed to be installed &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub, so we can use it &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> to build images. This allows the BinderHub instance to be used as a
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Service&lt;/a>, which is what we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this helm chart is currently under the 2i2c GitHub org, the hope is that it can eventually migrate to a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/519" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-contrib&lt;/a> organization (once it is created), or it can become the upstream helm chart for BinderHub if enough work can be done in BinderHub to allow it to serve use cases like mybinder.org.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this work, we also added a way for BinderHub to run in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1647" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >API only mode&lt;/a>, so we can fully turn off the UI &lt;em>and&lt;/em> launching ability of BinderHub. This change decoupled the
&lt;a href="" >three responsibilities of BinderHub&lt;/a> we discussed previously, allowing us to bring our own UI and JupyterHub. BinderHub could now be used &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> for its scalable image building features, which is exactly what we want!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">
Sustainably extending KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We identified KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> feature as the ideal location for UI to dynamically build environments (container images), making it just another &amp;rsquo;environment choice&amp;rsquo; people can choose, along with picking the resources their server needs. From an end-user perspective, it was also the logical place for them to specify a repository to build into an environment, as they could already choose some pre-built environments from here. They can also select other arbitrary resources they want (such as memory, GPU, etc) from here as well. From a maintainer perspective, it helps with long-term maintenance of the JupyterHub projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation of &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> however, was not easy to extend at this point. So
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/724" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this PR&lt;/a> improved how easy it was to extend it in more complex ways, without making the implementation in KubeSpawner itself complicated. Even though this had &lt;em>no&lt;/em> visible end-user effects, it was an extremely important step in allowing us to experiment with UI in a &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> way without having to rely on upstream. These kinds of changes can sometimes be hard to sell to stakeholders but are extremely important in ensuring a continuous and sustainable relationship with upstream.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">
Implementing &lt;code>unlisted_choice&lt;/code> feature in KubeSpawner
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The profileList feature was built to allow JupyterHub &lt;em>admins&lt;/em> to specify an explicit list of container images the end-user can choose from. It did not have a way for any choice that was &lt;em>not&lt;/em> pre-approved by the admin to be used. We needed this feature since the BinderHub API will build a new docker image for each environment the user wants, and so this can not be chosen from a pre-approved list. We had to safely add this feature to KubeSpawner in such a way that it was generally useful to everyone. Many other communities had been asking for such a feature anyway - the ability to simply &amp;rsquo;type in&amp;rsquo; an image and have that be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA&lt;/a> was one such community, so we partnered with

&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a> (an organization that helps run NASA VEDA) to implement this feature. Engineers from 2i2c contributed heavily to this feature as well, and after &lt;em>several&lt;/em> PRs (

&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >5&lt;/a>), this feature is now available for everyone to use!&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key component of doing &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> upstream work is that every addition needs to be useful by itself for a broad group of people. This change was very helpful for many communities that wanted to allow their users the freedom to pick whatever image they want to use, regardless of wether they wanted to use dynamic image building or not. The broad interest allowed us to build a coalition with other interested parties, and get the change accepted upstream more easily!&lt;/p>

&lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-fancy-profiles">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once we had all these pieces in place, it was time to actually work on the frontend UI that would allow users to build images dynamically and launch them. Since this will replace the &amp;lsquo;profileList&amp;rsquo; feature, it should also allow them to select different resources (RAM, CPU, etc) as needed, as well as type in an existing image if they desire. So it was a full re-implementation of the &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> frontend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is ongoing now at the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/a> project. It is a pure frontend web application, using modern frontend tooling (
&lt;a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >React&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >webpack&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Babel&lt;/a>, etc) and written in JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s gone through a few revisions, but the demo provided earlier in the blog post is in its current state. Because the default profileList implementation is pure HTML / CSS with very &lt;em>minimal&lt;/em> JS, it is limited in what kind of UX it could have. &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> aims to be very helpful &lt;em>even&lt;/em> when dynamic image-building features are not enabled on a JupyterHub. We hope to roll this out to a few JupyterHubs and improve it over time based on feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While building &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>, we wanted to use the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> javascript code used by BinderHub frontend to interact with the BinderHub API, instead of re-implementing it. However, the existing BinderHub JavaScript code was not easily consumable by external projects. We refactored the code, added tests, migrated to use modern JS practices and published the
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterhub/binderhub-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub/@binderhub-client&lt;/code> NPM package&lt;/a> that can be used not just by &lt;code>jupyerhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> but any external project for talking to the BinderHub API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This had to be done in such a way that current BinderHub installations (such as mybinder.org) do not break. That took quite a few pull requests:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1689" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >1&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1693" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2&lt;/a>,

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For Open Science to flourish, we need to allow access to resources without login / paywalls wherever possible. A new menace against this has been
&lt;a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Cybercrime/Cryptojacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cryptojacking&lt;/a> - where attackers use up any and all available free compute to mine cryptocurrencies. This has affected &lt;em>many&lt;/em> folks on the internet, including
&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-actions-being-actively-abused-to-mine-cryptocurrency-on-github-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GitHub Actions&lt;/a> and mybinder.org, the primary public BinderHub installation. mybinder.org has some extra protections against cryptojacking that aren&amp;rsquo;t easily usable elsewhere, and this has unfortunately meant that the demo JupyterHubs we have with these features enabled have been behind a login wall. I personally believe login walls are long term antithetical to open science, and so this was an important problem to solve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptnono/cryptnono" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cryptnono&lt;/a> is an open source project designed to help fight cryptojacking, and as part of this grant we ported some of this functionality out of mybinder.org specific code into cryptnono, so other deployments may also benefit from it! We also migrated to using the super efficient
&lt;a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ebpf&lt;/a> Linux Kernel subsystem, allowing for more complex heuristics to catch a much broader range of cryptomining activity. We have been slowly tweaking the config on mybinder.org, and it has proven to be very effective! This will be very helpful for &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> who wants to provide a JupyterHub (or any other computational service) without a login wall. If you are interested in using cryptnono in this fashion, please

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideRatio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker-service&lt;/a>, a separate JupyterHub service that could &lt;em>only&lt;/em> build images. As we worked on it, we realized that it was replicating a lot of features that BinderHub already has, so we pivoted to working on BinderHub directly instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Building off of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a>. While this already had a nice UI, it would be hard to port it to run on a distributed Kubernetes environment without it becoming a &amp;lsquo;hard fork&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While these did slow down the implementation of the project, it has allowed us to be very confident that the methods we have chosen are long-term sustainable.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is not complete of course, and there is a lot of future work to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>mybinder.org also helps you distribute your &lt;em>content&lt;/em>, not just the environment for your code to run in. Since JupyterHub usually comes with a persistent home directory for the user,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> is commonly used for this purpose instead. We should explore ways to integrate nbgitpuller (and other ways to distribute content) in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More thorough documentation for how you can recreate what is in the demo for yourself in your own JupyterHub installation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better UX for specifying images, including figuring out how to &amp;lsquo;save&amp;rsquo; them for future reuse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better compatibility with mybinder.org, particularly in allowing other sources of environments (not just GitHub, but Zenodo, raw git repositories, etc) and URL compatibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better authentication workflow between the frontend and the BinderHub API.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>JupyterHub is a versatile platform that can serve a desktop with Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software in the cloud. This was demonstrated by the QGreenland Researcher Workshop that was hosted by the NASA CryoCloud hub. The hands-on workshop trained 25-30 researchers, from Germany, India, France, Canada, Poland and the United States, on how to work with geospatial data in an open science framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="qgreenland-overview">
QGreenland Overview
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#qgreenland-overview">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://qgreenland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGreenland&lt;/a> is an open-source geospatial data package designed for QGIS, a community-owned GIS platform. It focuses on Greenland, offering researchers and educators a comprehensive toolset for FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) data analysis. The package integrates a variety of datasets into a single, easy-to-use data-viewing and analysis platform, supporting both offline and online use. This makes it particularly valuable for remote fieldwork and areas with limited internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workshop-success">
Workshop Success
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#workshop-success">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The QGreenland workshop demonstrated several key benefits of using JupyterHub for cloud-based GIS:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Accessibility: Participants from across the world could access the same powerful GIS tools through a web browser, eliminating the need for complex local installations while enhancing reproducibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud block storage: Using a JupyterHub in the cloud allowed for faster data access than a traditional NFS file store by provisioning each user with an elastic block store disk, reducing load times from 5 minutes to under 3 seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cost Efficiency: Utilizing the CryoCloud JupyterHub instance managed by 2i2c drastically cut down setup costs and time, with only minimal cloud operating expenses of roughly $1/person/day.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The success of the QGreenland workshop underscores the potential of integrating interactive software applications in JupyterHub. This approach not only democratizes access to advanced geospatial tools but also fosters a collaborative research environment. We look forward to supporting more workshops for QGreenland in the future!&lt;/p>
