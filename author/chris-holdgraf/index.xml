&lt;p>
&lt;a href="mybinder.org">Mybinder.org&lt;/a>
enables researchers across the world to replicate computational environments in the cloud. It allows researchers to turn static code into interactive literate coding environments with a click of a button within seconds. The
&lt;a href="mybinder.org">mybinder.org&lt;/a>
service is powered by
&lt;a href="binderhub.readthedocs.io">BinderHub&lt;/a>
, an open-source tool developed by
&lt;a href="jupyter.org">the Jupyter Project&lt;/a>
that many organizations have deployed for their own communities. It does this by _dynamically building _the software environment needed to reproduce a computation (using a tool called
&lt;a href="repo2docker.readthedocs.io">repo2docker&lt;/a>
), and making this environment available to users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BinderHub was developed for use-cases that are &lt;em>temporary&lt;/em> and _fully open _by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past several years, the
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GESIS Notebooks&lt;/a>
team made the first steps towards bridging this gap through their
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persistent BinderHub&lt;/a>
implementation. This was a modified and authenticated BinderHub that &lt;em>included&lt;/em> persistent storage across sessions. The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFDI4DS&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CESSDA&lt;/a>
, and members of the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMTE&lt;/a>
project. This collaboration has three primary goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generalize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure&lt;/strong>, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects&lt;/strong>, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub&lt;/strong>, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See
&lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this GitHub Projects Board for issues that implement this effort&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">Exploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the
&lt;a href="http://binderhub.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>
. We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persistent BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>
. The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modified Helm Chart&lt;/a>
that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality &lt;em>natively&lt;/em> into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to take another approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">Exploration 2: Add dynamic image building to JupyterHub&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, &lt;strong>we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using
&lt;a href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a>
project that
&lt;a href="https://quantstack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuantStack&lt;/a>
had built for the
&lt;a href="https://plasmabio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlasmaBio project&lt;/a>
. This implementation was seen as successful, and something others in the community had wanted to generalize for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="our-implementation-plan">Our implementation plan&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="two-phases-of-implementation">Two phases of implementation&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a back-end for dynamic environment building&lt;/strong>. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and is easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are a few tasks that we’re carrying out next to make progress on the above two items.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a working prototype for image generation via a &lt;em>JupyterHub Service&lt;/em> (see below for current status)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research the &lt;code>tljh-repo2docker&lt;/code> code base to understand how we could build upon its UX and functionality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the typical process that GESIS and NFDI users follow in their BinderHub workflows, to ensure that it can be replicated via this new implementation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform UI/UX research validation to inform the implementation from a user’s perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a follow-up, we’ll likely re-work the BinderHub codebase to utilize JupyterHub’s new repo2docker service, rather than defining its own custom repo2docker functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">Back-end implementation as a JupyterHub Service&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We’re planning to use
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub Services&lt;/a>
to add the back-end functionality for dynamic image building to a JupyterHub. Services are a way to expose functionality via a JupyterHub REST API, and would allow us to expose basic image generation on-the-fly with
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
. We aim for basic functionality to be as close as possible to repo2docker’s default behavior, but to make this functionality _composable and customizable _if a JupyterHub administrator wants to provide different out-of-the-box functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While details may still change, we believe that the major architectural plan has now been settled. We have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an experimental codebase&lt;/a>
with a basic implementation of the repo2docker service described above. As part of this effort, this team has also made a number of improvements to repo2docker’s codebase and project infrastructure. We hope that this effort will continue to push resources and attention to repo2docker by growing the number of users and stakeholders that rely on the project for their success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">Front-end implementation that uses this service&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Once the back-end setup exists, we can use it to begin prototyping user interactions that can trigger and use repo2docker’s image generation. Bringing dynamic environment image building into JupyterHub is a significant improvement in its functionality, and may introduce new kinds of workflows that we hadn’t initially imagined. Understanding, interpreting, and extending the original “Persistent BinderHub” workflow will require a more thorough understanding of user stories and needs in order to identify new workflows that feel natural not only in a JupyterHub scenario but also in a Binder-like scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here are a few major UI/UX questions we must answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When a user builds an image, should it also become available to &lt;em>other users&lt;/em> as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can a user store, find, and delete old images that they’ve built?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about new versions of the same image?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should we simply mimic the mybinder.org UX, or should this be improved as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We must answer these and several other questions next. With that vision in place, we’d like to &lt;strong>expand our efforts in UI/UX and user research&lt;/strong>. This will help inform the technical implementation of this work as we expand on our prototype, and help us choose the right way to expose this functionality to users. We welcome collaboration around this work - if you know of an organization that is interested in collaboration, please reach out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a few months working on this project, we are even more excited about the potential for dynamically building environments in a JupyterHub. We believe that it adds a new class of workflows to JupyterHubs that were not possible before, and will be immediately useful to the hundreds of communities that deploy JupyterHub for their communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Grant progress report: CZI Foundational grant year 2</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>We recently completed a progress report for Year 2 of our primary CZI funding grant.

&lt;h2 id="service-improvements">Service improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We made a number of improvements to our cloud infrastructure and the processes around our service.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief breakdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We expanded our shared clusters to new cloud providers and regions&lt;/strong>. We now have shared clusters already deployed on Google Cloud Platform on &lt;code>us-central1-b&lt;/code> and &lt;code>europe-west2&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We defined an incident commander process&lt;/strong>. This will allow us to coordinate and respond to major outages in our cloud infrastructure more efficiently. See
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/projects/managed-hubs/incidents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our incident response documentation&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We improved our cloud usage monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a centralized Grafana Dashboard&lt;/a>
that aggregates cloud usage across all of our partner communities, and allows us to keep track of any unexpected behavior or outages across them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-were-focusing-next">Where we&amp;rsquo;re focusing next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In the final quarter of this year, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus our efforts on &lt;strong>growing capacity&lt;/strong> across all of the aspects of our team.
Now that we have brought on several more partner communities into our Managed JupyterHub Service, it has shown us where we have bottlenecks in our technology, process, and structure.
In 2023 we hope to significantly grow the number of communities we work with, and so we must grow our capacity to be able to take on these new partnerships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aim to accomplish this in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make technical improvements&lt;/strong> to our cloud infrastructure that reduces the amount of human labor associated with regular actions. This will make our cloud infrastructure more scalable and reliable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and partnership leads pipeline&lt;/strong> so that we can reduce the amount of administrative toil for ourselves and for the communities we work with in billing and cloud cost pass-through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Refine our organizational strategy and structure&lt;/strong> so that we are better-able to agree on our most important objectives, and to execute on them efficiently as a distributed team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hire people!&lt;/strong> While improving our efficiency will certainly grow our capacity, we also hope to grow our capacity the old fashioned way: by hiring more team members. We&amp;rsquo;re identifying the biggest needs on our team now and will hope to have postings soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="thanks">Thanks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many thanks to the 2i2c team, our partner communities, our funders, and the many others that have provided us support and guidance. We hope that this update provides a helpful idea of our priorities and major efforts, and we look forward to giving you a new update in Q4!&lt;/p>

It is a brainstorm from the Executive Director, shared as a blog post to invite feedback and provide transparency into our current thinking. Its goal is to explore the context of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s stakeholders and their needs, and identify an opportunity and plan for having a positive impact with these communities. It is not a concrete proposal but a snapshot of thinking in time meant to trigger reflection. Over time we will incorporate some of these ideas
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we founded 2i2c, we largely did so from the &amp;ldquo;bottom up&amp;rdquo; - we identified several patterns around hosted infrastructure that were useful at
&lt;a href="https://datahub.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>
, and similar communities, and we wished to make them more generalized, accessible, and scalable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We defined our mission as the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Our mission is to make research and education more impactful, accessible, and delightful by developing, operating, and supporting infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And a description about our immediate activities to make things a bit more concrete:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>2i2c designs, develops, and operates JupyterHubs in the cloud for communities of practice in research &amp;amp; education. It builds and supports open source infrastructure that serves these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Around a year ago
&lt;a href="http://2i2c.org/blog/2021/six-month-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we began our pilot JupyterHubs project&lt;/a>
to learn more about our biggest challenges and opportunities in making interactive computing more accessible and useful for research and education.
While both of these statements are still accurate, over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned more about the value that 2i2c provides. This post is an exploration of how these statements and our strategy may evolve in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-did-we-miss-with-our-original-strategy">What did we miss with our original strategy?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In short: it is too-focused on &lt;strong>actions&lt;/strong> rather than &lt;strong>impact&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While running JupyterHubs is a key part of what 2i2c does, it is a means to an end rather than our end-goal.
Infrastructure is only useful if it changes workflows in a way that aligns with the goals and values that we wish to achieve.
We&amp;rsquo;ve historically defined these in a few scattered places. For example, here are the values listed on our website:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2i2c values fairness and justice as requirements for successful communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2i2c values learning and discovery for all people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2i2c values collaborating and connecting to foster environments for learning and discovery.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>However, it is difficult to tie our operations directly to values and goals without making them concrete, and without defining a plan that ties them to our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through our JupyterHubs pilot, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned how our actions-focused approach was missing some important aspects of these broader goals.
For example, we came to understand that a big part of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s value isn&amp;rsquo;t just providing a JupyterHub, it is &lt;em>de-risking cloud native workflows&lt;/em> for communities that are inherently skeptical of what cloud infrastructure offers.
Doing this entails many things: teaching, making decisions on behalf of others, supporting and answering questions, building trust, and yes, managing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="refining-our-strategy">Refining our strategy&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With this in mind, we&amp;rsquo;d like to &lt;strong>make our strategy more clearly-defined and tied to our operational choices&lt;/strong>. Here are a few ways we&amp;rsquo;d like to do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Define our organization&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>values and vision&lt;/strong> for the impact we wish to have.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define the key &lt;strong>stakeholder communities&lt;/strong> that we wish to serve, the context of tools and services that are relevant to these stakeholders, and the assumptions we&amp;rsquo;re making.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define the &lt;strong>problems these stakeholders have&lt;/strong>, the ways in which their current workflow could be improved, and the opportunity to help them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Describe our &lt;strong>strategy&lt;/strong> to positively impact these stakeholders with our work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define a collection of &lt;strong>goals and objectives&lt;/strong> to carry out this strategy in the near-term.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The rest of this post will take a crack at answering a few of these questions. It is intentionally messy, and meant both as a public snapshot of my thinking at this moment, and fodder for discussion and more specific proposals in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="context-our-key-stakeholders-and-the-impact-we-wish-to-have">Context: Our key stakeholders and the impact we wish to have&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s key stakeholders are communities of practice that are dedicated to creating and sharing public knowledge.
These are primarily made up of &lt;strong>researchers&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>educators&lt;/strong> in the global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For these stakeholders, we wish to catalyze and support a transformation in their data workflows that allows them to be more collaborative, inclusive, efficient, and powerful in the impact they wish to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="assumptions-we-make-about-our-stakeholders">Assumptions we make about our stakeholders&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>There are a few unique things about these communities that are important for us:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Researchers and educators see their job as &lt;strong>creating and sharing knowledge with a heterogeneous and global community&lt;/strong>. They can&amp;rsquo;t make many assumptions about the organizational context or resources of this community, or their work will become inaccessible to others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They &lt;strong>work at vertically-oriented institutions&lt;/strong> (e.g., a university with an in-house IT department), but their communities are &lt;strong>organized horizontally across institutions&lt;/strong> (a researcher may identify more with colleagues in their field than with their co-workers at the university).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a result, these communities &lt;strong>value workflows that are maximally accessible, portable, modular, simple, and long-lasting&lt;/strong>. This allows them to define a shared set of practices across their institutional boundaries without requiring a lot of vertical decision-making.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Historically, this means that scientists must choose between workflows that are underpowered but accessible (e.g., collapsed into a PDF describing the work), or powerful but inaccessible to many (e.g., they rely on extensive training or resources only accessible to some institutions).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-source-tools-have-boosted-standardization-and-collaboration-across-communities">Open source tools have boosted standardization and collaboration across communities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Over the past ten years, the proliferation of open source tools has vastly expanded our potential to create public knowledge in a more accessible, modular, inclusive, and productive way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, core numerical computing infrastructure like
&lt;a href="https://numpy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NumPy&lt;/a>
provides a foundation for more domain specific numerical libraries to build on. Tools like
&lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pandas&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://xarray.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XArray&lt;/a>
allow for more sophisticated data structures that match the complex and heterogeneous data in the research community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has led to many domain-specific communities of practice building upon the same APIs and infrastructure to solve their specific needs. By largely sharing the same stack, we have reduced duplication of effort and make it easier to speak the same language across data-rich fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="but-a-local-workflow-with-open-source-tools-is-inaccessible-or-underpowered-for-many-people">&amp;hellip;but a local workflow with open source tools is inaccessible or underpowered for many people&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>However, this has also led to a few key problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 1: The ecosystem of open source tools is huge and complex, and hard to tailor for specific domain workflows&lt;/strong>. It is hard to decide which tools to use for a workflow, and we do not have efficient community processes for creating and standardizing workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 2: For many users, it is still too difficult to set up a local environment&lt;/strong>. Installing the right libraries and their dependencies is complex and domain-specific. This leads to wasted time and confusion, especially for newcomers or learners in an educational context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, there is another workflow-related problem that arises even when you do set up a proper environment:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 3: Local workflows are not scalable enough for many communities&lt;/strong>. Working with 10GB of data can be challenging in a local context, working with 10TB of data quickly becomes impossible. This leads to communities that &amp;ldquo;share data&amp;rdquo; by making lots of local copies that are distributed to individual users. This harms data provenance and makes our work less reproducible and accessible. It limits the scope of questions we can ask with data and increases the friction for sharing our work with others. As our workflows require more computation and data, a &amp;ldquo;local, fixed hardware&amp;rdquo; approach will become more and more underpowered.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managed-cloud-services-can-solve-the-accessibility-problem-for-many-workflows-and-tools">Managed cloud services can solve the accessibility problem for many workflows and tools&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>One way to resolve these problems is to rely on &lt;strong>managed infrastructure services&lt;/strong> to provide the environments needed for data analysis. A systems administrator can set up computing and data resources, and then expose these resources to many users as a service. This makes these complex and powerful environments more accessible, standardizes the workflows of users to make it easier for them to collaborate, and potentially serves as a gateway to more complex data and computing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, this work was done in-house by internal teams at research institutions. This led to many unique infrastructure setups with slight differences across institutions. It also led to data and workflows being institution-centric, even though many communities are organized &lt;em>across&lt;/em> institutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure can solve this problem&lt;/strong>. It provides a layer of infrastructure that can be used to standardize access and worfklows across communities of practice. It can be more accessible than on-prem infrastructure, as the cloud is already globally distributed in a way that local hardware can never be. Moreover, cloud infrastructure is also much more scalable, and can be used to access more sophisticated data and computing resources in a fluid manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="but-the-cloud-services-landscape-is-not-designed-for-research-and-education-communities">But the cloud services landscape is not designed for research and education communities&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Over the last 10 years, a huge ecosystem of cloud-native tools and services have grown to solve this problem in industry. These are often called the
&lt;a href="https://future.com/emerging-architectures-modern-data-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Data Stack&lt;/a>
. However, &lt;strong>modern cloud services are largely unused by research and education&lt;/strong>. Why is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe it is because most cloud services do not meet many needs of research and educational communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They tend to be offered by a single vendor, which results in a fear of lock-in or vendor-specific workflows that result in high-costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They require users to learn non-standard workflows that are attached to the cloud service.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They often require extensive knowledge of data and cloud resources to configure properly. They may require an internal dev-ops team to integrate cloud services and expose them for internal teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are often still institution-centric because cloud services are geared towards enterprise contracts within vertically-integrated organizations. Many research organizations are more like collections of little fiefdoms rather than a single kingdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In short, &lt;strong>many cloud services ask researchers and educators to give up too much agency and choice, and make them reliant on organizations they do not inherently trust&lt;/strong>. They are perceived as a risky alternative to the &amp;ldquo;we have control and have visibility into everything&amp;rdquo; nature of on-prem hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="examples-of-a-potential-model-for-community-centric-cloud-services">Examples of a potential model for community-centric cloud services&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Over the past several years we have seen several communities strike a balance that made cloud infrastructure more accessible while still retaining agency for the communities of practice that used and managed the infrastructure.
For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Pangeo Project&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud-native geospatial analytics platform&lt;/a>
that builds on the Dask, Zarr, and XArray stack to enable distributed and collaborative access to large-scale geospatial datasets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud-native educational community&lt;/a>
that uses a managed service to provide interactive learning environments to thousands of students via the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Syzygy service&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federated network of educational hubs&lt;/a>
that run entirely on open source infrastructure in the cloud, managed for universities in Canada.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each of these communities roughly followed the same model:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integrate&lt;/strong> a collection of open source tools and cloud services into a standardized cloud environment for a community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Customize&lt;/strong> the environment and cloud resources via open source tools that provide remote interactive computing sessions. This is usually done with
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Contribute&lt;/strong> to upstream tools and redeploy improvements to a community&amp;rsquo;s shared infrastucture in order to enhance the service.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Moreover, they use nearly identical technical stacks: some combination of Jupyter infrastructure to manage cloud infrastructure and provide interactive computing environments, a Scientific Python or R-based stack for the libraries users access, and a collection of online services to facilitate collaboration and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These services required a combination of &lt;strong>dev-ops and cloud engineering&lt;/strong> skills to integrate the tools and manage the infrastructure, as well as &lt;strong>community guidance and teaching&lt;/strong> to standardize and share workflows across a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why couldn&amp;rsquo;t this model just be repeated across many other communities as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="however-running-your-own-cloud-infrastructure-is-a-lot-of-work">However, running your own cloud infrastructure is a lot of work&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>These initiatives demonstrate the potential of building community-centric cloud services on top of open source tools, but they were also unscalable to other communities. Observing these success stories also reveals a few more problems that we must resolve in order to make these services more generalizable and accessible to new communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 4: Running your own cloud requires skills and resources that most organizations do not have&lt;/strong>. In order to make the most of the cloud and to provide it as a resource reliable-enough for important workflows, it is important to have a knowledgeable team with best-practices in distributed cloud management. However, hiring engineers in this space is very difficult, and the team structure and culture needed for these services is often at-odds with the way universities are structured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 5: Contributing to open source communities requires dedicated time and skills&lt;/strong>. When building services on top of open source tools, you will invariably need to improve the tools in order to fix bugs or to enhance your service. Doing this is very different from a contract with a traditional vendor, and requires building skills in how to communicate and interact with open source communities. For key open source infrastructure, it also requires an ongoing investment of time into upstream community work that is hard for many institutions to justify.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 6: When institutions run their own clouds, they tend to re-invent institution-centric anti-patterns.&lt;/strong> For example, an institution might expose a cloud-based service but make it available only to individuals with an institutional account.
They might staff it with an under-resourced team (or just a single person). They might make small decisions that differ from institution to institution. All of this limits the effectiveness of the cloud for facilitating collaboration and sharing within communities of practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, while vendor-specific cloud services often come with a lot of training material, self-managed cloud services require institutions to build their own practices and guidance for how to use the infrastructure. This results in another major problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 7: Communities need assistance in understanding what is possible with cloud-native workflows, and adapting these workflows to their domains.&lt;/strong> There is enormous value in integrating tools together and exposing them as a highly-accessible managed service via the cloud. However, most communities of practice are still new to cloud-native workflows, and they need considerable guidance to begin sharing their practices within a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are several major problems that we must overcome in order to make cloud infrastructure more accessible and useful to research and education communities while living up to our values of community agency and open workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-opportunity-for-impact">Our opportunity for impact&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To summarize, we believe that there is the following opportunity for impact:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make communities in research and education do work that is more collaborative, reproducible, and impactful&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a way that gives them agency and flexibility to do their work as they wish&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By integrating open tools and standards, managing them as a service with scalable cloud infrastructure, and guiding communities in deciding how to use these tools for their domain-specific problems&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We believe that the best way to do this is via a mission-aligned non-profit service that is based on values of trust, shared responsibility, and transparency. This will allow us to treat our relationships with communities as &lt;strong>collaborators, not customers&lt;/strong> and share responsibility and agency with them. In this way we can act as a vehicle for &lt;strong>sharing resources and ideas across communities&lt;/strong> via our infrastructure and services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can make such a service both &lt;strong>sustainable&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>scalable&lt;/strong> because we are delivering direct value to communities with resources. There are many
&lt;a href="https://www.ffwd.org/playbook/choose-a-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential business models&lt;/a>
that are already in existence (for example, &lt;em>Software as a Service&lt;/em> or shared research infrastructure services like supercomputing centers). By generating resources in exchange for these services, we can &lt;strong>centralize cloud infrastructure services for many communities into a single, scalable team&lt;/strong>. By committing ourselves to an &lt;em>upstream-first service model&lt;/em>, we can &lt;strong>drive resources towards open source communities&lt;/strong> and make these tools more useful for our key stakeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A model like this naturally sets up a two-directional virtuous cycle where open source communities and public knowledge communities derive value from one another&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="how-should-2i2c-try-to-achieve-this-impact">How should 2i2c try to achieve this impact&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>With this in mind, we hope to focus our organizational efforts around building services that focus on the following actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integrate&lt;/strong> open source tools and services into a cloud-native service that is optimized for scientific workflows and communities. The end-product should not feel like &amp;ldquo;a 2i2c product&amp;rdquo; but a service anybody with enough skills could build themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manage&lt;/strong> cloud infrastructure with an &amp;ldquo;upstream first&amp;rdquo; mentality to provide a high-quality and accessible service for global communities. This will allow communities to focus on their work instead of the infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support&lt;/strong> the communities that use this infrastructure so that questions and problems are dealt with quickly. This will de-risk the service (and the cloud more generally) with the knowledge that help is available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guide&lt;/strong> communities in using these tools to do their work more effectively and collaboratively. This will speed up the learning and sharing process so that communities are able to make the most of the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collaborate&lt;/strong> with these communities and embody the values we want to see in the research community to build trust and lead others. This will build trust and strengthen relationships between our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Over time, we may add new verbs (such as &lt;strong>develop&lt;/strong> open source software and &lt;strong>lead&lt;/strong> open source communities), but the ones above define our initial organizational focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-most-important-actions-to-take">Our most important actions to take&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Accomplishing this requires blending aspects of cloud infrastructure management, domain and workflow expertise, and collaborative service design. As we move forward, these are the biggest challenges to overcome in developing this service further:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a top-notch global Site Reliability Engineering Team&lt;/strong>. First and foremost, the infrastructure that we manage must be reliable and scalable. If you ask communities to do their work in the cloud, they must be confident that it will be stable and highly available. If you wish to serve a global community, then you must build systems management capacity on a global level. This means investing heavily in our asynchronous coordination and communication processes, and building team skills in the modern cloud infrastructure stack and dev-ops practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build centralized cloud deployment infrastructure for community-first services&lt;/strong>. We need the ability to centrally manage infrastructure that is delivered in a community-specific manner to many different communities of practice. This will allow us to achieve economies of scale in managing and running the infrastructure, while allowing communities to have agency over their tools to customize them for their needs. To do this we&amp;rsquo;ll need to use open source tools and cloud services that are designed for flexibility and modularity, create out-of-the-box infrastructure that gets communities 80% of the way there, and gives them the power to define the last 20% in a way that is sustainable for both them and our team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define two or three scientific workflows to focus on, and integrate the right tools and services into a distribution for each&lt;/strong>. We must identify a few scientific workflows to focus on, as well as the infrastructure stack that will be most-useful to the communities that require these workflows. We must integrate this infrastructure into a distribution that any community could pick up, but that has enough flexibility for each to solve their &amp;ldquo;last-mile problem&amp;rdquo; with customizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define a support and guidance model for community-first services&lt;/strong>. Our support and guidance similarly needs to be generic enough to be scalable to many kinds of communities, but with the ability for communities to make their own customizations and have agency over their training and content. In this way we can be a centralized resource that communities can use to grow their own practice of cloud-native workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify a collaborative service delivery model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t create too much overhead&lt;/strong>. We believe that community-centric infrastructure should be transparent and participatory, and provide agency to communities in shaping their service. On the other hand, we wish to serve many different communities, and thus we must minimize the amount of labor associated with serving any particular community. As a result we must build a collaborative model of roles and expectations around our services that balances participation from community representatives against our ability to act quickly to ensure the best service possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify a cost-recovery model that is globally accessible and scalable&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve a large and global collection of communities with our services, and so we must identify a way to recover our costs such that we are not restricted to serving only the wealthiest communities in the world, and such that &amp;ldquo;cost vs. resources generated&amp;rdquo; gives us the flexibility to grow to serve a large global community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an upstream-first culture&lt;/strong>. If we wish to leverage open source tools in our work, we need to build team expertise in interacting with open source communities, deploying their technology in our services, and making improvements to our service by upstream contributions to open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an organizational culture that embodies the values we want to support&lt;/strong>. In order to build a better, more collaborative, more inclusive network of communities of practice, we need to embody the principles we wish to help grow in other communities. This will help us build trust with organizations that are inherently skeptical of &amp;ldquo;outsourcing&amp;rdquo; responsibilities to other organizations, and will make us more effective advocates for the same kinds of practices in other communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There are many other issues we must tackle, but we&amp;rsquo;ve identified these as being crucial to 2i2c accomplishing its mission. Over the coming months we will continue to refine our practices and service model. As we learn more, we&amp;rsquo;ll update our understanding of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s situation and potential for impact, and our strategy for accomplishing our mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this framing helps others understand our position relative to the communities we wish to serve, and the impact we wish to have. We welcome any feedback or suggestions about how we can refine these ideas to better-serve our communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="appendix-future-growth">Appendix: Future growth&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Many people also ask what the growth model looks like for 2i2c.
Our pricing strategy above should include our goal of &lt;strong>building a financial buffer&lt;/strong> in order to boost the financial resiliency of the organization, and to provide us room to grow if there is an opportunity to expand our service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we want to focus our efforts on the strategic goals described above, here is how I think 2i2c could grow its operations and expand its impact as a next step.
These are initiatives for which we might seek grant funding to experiment with sustainable and scalable models.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create a software development team&lt;/strong>. Right now our technical efforts are focused on &lt;em>integrating&lt;/em> pre-existing tools and services, and &lt;em>managing&lt;/em> these services in the cloud. However there are many opportunities to &lt;em>create&lt;/em> and &lt;em>enhance&lt;/em> the ecosystem of tools that is out there. Doing dedicated software development is very different from Site Reliability Engineering, and we will need to build our financial and staffing capacity to dedicate team members to this work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Expand the kinds of cloud services we offer&lt;/strong>. Currently we focus our efforts around providing &lt;em>research and analysis platforms&lt;/em> in the cloud. These are often connected to other cloud resources (like datasets) but we do not manage them ourselves. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to strategically grow the services we provide - most notably in the area of cloud data management and migration. However, this is beyond our current capacity and we will need to grow more before moving in this direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an open source support operation&lt;/strong>. There are many things that open source communities need beyond technical improvements. Providing community, operational, and strategic support is another way that 2i2c could use its resources and experience to benefit open source communities that we work with. However, we need to better-understand how to do this in a way that is sustainable for us, and that respects open source communities as independent organizations with their own mission, strategy, and expectations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create a cloud infrastructure training operation&lt;/strong>. Many communities we work with &lt;em>aspire to run their own cloud infrastructure&lt;/em>. They wish to work with a trusted partner like 2i2c in the short-term, but in the long term they want to build their own capacity in running similar services. 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s cloud services are a unique opportunity for others to get hands-on training to grow their skills. Perhaps there is a way for us to share this experience with members from other communities in a way that they can then bring back with them to other organizations. There will be an inherent tension between this and our sustainability model from ongoing services, but we believe it is an important opportunity to explore since it aligns with our values of community agency and choice.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="problem-statement">Problem statement&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Cloud infrastructure is a powerful way to broaden access to workflows and infrastructure across the globe.
However, it is also inaccessible to many for a variety of reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a large, diverse, and messy ecosystem of open source tools to facilitate cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most communities don&amp;rsquo;t already have skills in utilizing cloud workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Running infrastructure in the cloud takes dedicated time and expertise that many communities lack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many communities do not have organized communities of practice around cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These issues are true for most scientific communities, but they are exacerbated in countries that are often marginalized in the global scientific community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-proposed-work">Our proposed work&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>For this reason, our goal in this grant is to &lt;strong>provide human and technical services to facilitate learning and knowledge transfer of cloud workflows for communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It defines four major areas of collaboration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure management&lt;/strong> - to facilitate access to cloud resources via managed cloud services that integrate open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Application guidance and training&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with the skills to utilize this infrastructure for their needs. This includes language-localized content and training materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Training for trainers&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to share these workflows with others in their communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Community leadership and management&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to sustain and grow healthy communities of practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If this proposal is funded, over the course of two years the team will provide a combination of the services described above for communities in Latin America and Africa, with the goal of understanding how such services can be most useful for these communities, how we can structure them to provide community representation in the direction of these services, and how we can sustain and scale this model of community-focused services for a global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Importantly, we wish to do this work in a way that centers the communities we work with as co-leaders and collaborators in these services.
We will explore ways to run these services and workshops so that they are transparent, inclusive, and give agency to the communities they support.
Ultimately, we hope that this can be an extensible model for many more communities in the future.&lt;/p>

This is a quick post to celebrate the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past three months, and to briefly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main highlights from this quarter - if you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out more of the work that we&amp;rsquo;ve done, see:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/pulls?q=is%3Apr&amp;#43;merged%3A%3E2022-01-01&amp;#43;org%3A2i2c-org&amp;#43;archived%3Afalse&amp;#43;sort%3Aupdated-desc&amp;#43;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">All the PRs we&amp;rsquo;ve merged in Q1&lt;/a>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-improvements">Infrastructure improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This quarter we did a deep dive into a number of core infrastructure improvements for our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed JupyterHubs Service&lt;/a>
.
Here are a few highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infrastructure reliability and efficiency&lt;/strong>. We
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of our deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>
. For example, we refactored our hub configuration so that each community is better-able to track it, we implemented validation steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally push incorrect config to the hubs, and we&amp;rsquo;ve significantly improved our CI/CD pipeline to push deployments out to our hubs more efficiently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automatic deployments to commercial cloud&lt;/strong>. With the ICESat hackweek as a test-case for AWS, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished automating the deployment of clusters and hubs to each major commercial cloud. (there&amp;rsquo;s not a specific issue for this as it has been a multi-month effort over many PRs and issues!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CILogon authentication&lt;/strong>.
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
is a non-profit organization that provides &amp;ldquo;single-sign on&amp;rdquo; authentication services for the same communities that 2i2c serves. We&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with them to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/1089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prototype using CILogon for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s hubs&lt;/a>
, which should make it much easier for communities to user their own institutional sign-ons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">Communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served and lessons learned&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As described in
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Managed Hub Services strategy&lt;/a>
, our goals for this phase of our organization are to balance &lt;em>serving communities of practice&lt;/em> and &lt;em>learning where we can improve our infrastructure and practices&lt;/em>.
With that in mind, here are a few highlights of communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served, and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We grew a hub for
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the University of Toronto&lt;/a>
to around 4000 monthly users&lt;/strong>. This has taught us a lot about where our support and operations can and cannot scale, and where we have gaps in our sustainability / pricing model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed CILogon on a hub for
&lt;a href="https://anu.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a class at Australian National University&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This gives us an opportunity to work out any UX issues and improvements to be made before a deeper CILogon integration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a dedicated database per user for
&lt;a href="https://utexas.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a databases course at UT Austin&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This is helping us learn more about how to pair slightly more customized per-user infrastructure with our standard hub setups, as well as how our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate model&lt;/a>
could be followed for more complex setups like a database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scotty_h_q/status/1508557909751320577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ICESat2 HackWeek&lt;/a>
at the University of Washington&lt;/strong>. This helped refine our infrastructure and expertise with AWS, as well as improved our event &amp;ldquo;ready mode&amp;rdquo; practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a new hub for
&lt;a href="https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LEAP project&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This has given us an opportunity to prototype new processes for pass-through cloud costs to simplify our deployments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizational improvements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond our technical and community impact work, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of significant organizational improvements as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new role in Product and Community Management&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re excited for this new hire to spearhead efforts in guiding and developing relationships with the communities we serve, as well as guiding and collaborating with our engineering team in developing our services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Project Manager role&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. Our engineering team had been operating as a largely autonomous and independent group, but we&amp;rsquo;ve realized that we would benefit from someone to help coordinate our actions and plans, especially as we balance more operations/support issues in addition to new development. This new role is an experiment at growing this capacity within our team, in the hopes that we can dedicate a team member to it in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are still working out our major priorities for the oncoming quarter, but have a few major projects in the works that we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful to make progress on quickly.
Here are a few major examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our process and operations around supporting our users&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing first- and second-line support processes&lt;/a>
to make our team more responsive and effective at resolving incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and contracting process&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing how to reduce toil associated with invoicing&lt;/a>
in order to make this practice more reliable and efficient, along with our fiscal sponsor
&lt;a href="https://codeforscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving our reporting and monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;d like to boost our ability to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitor activity on each of our hubs&lt;/a>
in order to identify when something abnormal is happening and get ahead of any potential problems (e.g., to avoid unintentionally large cloud bills). We&amp;rsquo;d also like to improve our usage reporting to more create more accurate cloud bills for hubs running on multi-tenant clusters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a lot more planned for 2i2c, and if you&amp;rsquo;re curious to see what we&amp;rsquo;re up to, we invite you to
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our team compass&lt;/a>
to learn about our practices, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch our activity on GitHub&lt;/a>
to see our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to the amazing 2i2c team, and the multiple open source and scholarly communities that we collaborate with to make all of this possible. In addition, we are grateful to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/about/funding.md">our funders&lt;/a>
for making this possible. We are looking forward to Q2! 🎉&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes from our drop-in meeting about the Product and Community Lead role</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday we had a quick &amp;ldquo;drop-in&amp;rdquo; session to take questions about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead">job posting for a Product and Community Lead&lt;/a>
.
We spent the hour discussing a number of questions that others had about the position.
Below is a short overview of the questions and some responses, for those who were not able to attend.
These responses are a bit rough, since they are mostly off-the-cuff based on the questions asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2022-03-24&lt;/strong>: We&amp;rsquo;ve added extra questions and answers below from our latest drop-in meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-success-look-like-in-the-short-and-long-term">What does success look like in the short and long term?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is an important question, with a few different kinds of answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As noted, this is the first hire of its kind inside of 2i2c, and it should bring a strategic and organization-building eye to the work that it does.
To some extent, this role will be tasked with coming up with their own answers to these questions.
This person should build a near- and long-term strategy for how Product and Community Engagement should evolve to be most-effective in accomplishing our mission.
This will also mean defining goals and a strategy to meet these goals over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind, here are a few ideas we have in mind for goals that will drive this role:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6 month goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Become familiar with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organization, culture, mission, and team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define an early strategy for how you&amp;rsquo;d like to incorporate Product and Community engagement into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s operations, and set some Objectives or Key Results that we should use to measure success. This should include a plan for the two major objectives of this role: guiding and connecting with the communities we serve, and building design and planning processes that bring this perspective into our engineering and services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A few iterations on the execution of this strategy, with some demonstration of impact as well as some documented lessons learned.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 year goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An organizational strategy and structure has been created, defining the various roles that make up this division of 2i2c and their functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clearly defined team processes for major programs efforts that this role oversees, as well as interconnections with other major divisions of 2i2c (e.g. engineering or sales). For example, a framework for training community leaders and mechanisms or platforms for communication and engagement with our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A team exists that carries out these efforts, led by the Product and Community Lead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clear demonstrated impact in the communities we serve, according to the OKRs and goals that have been set in this division.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-2i2c-provide-mentorshiponboarding">How does 2i2c provide mentorship/onboarding?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can find
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/get-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our onboarding process in our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.
This roughly comes down to choosing an &amp;ldquo;Onboarding Champion&amp;rdquo; for the new team member, to help walk them through our team processes and get them access to the right information and accounts.
However, 2i2c is quite young, so has only had a few iterations in onboarding new team members.
We look forward to improving this process further via this new hire.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-largest-challenges-that-someone-might-face-in-their-first-year-in-this-position">What are the largest challenges that someone might face in their first year in this position?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The largest challenge is largely related to ambiguity and fluidity of this role, due to the fact that 2i2c is small and relatively young.
As noted above, this position will have a great deal of autonomy, and will be expected to show leadership in defining the nature of this work within 2i2c.
This can either be exciting or scary depending on your comfort level with ambiguity!
We recognize that it is an anti-pattern to have roles without clearly-defined measures of success, so we&amp;rsquo;re committed to defining this quickly in partnership with the new hire.
However, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be overly-prescriptive in this role, because we want it to have space to lead these efforts within 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-hope-to-protect-the-business-aspects-of-2i2c-if-all-the-tech-is-open-source">How do you hope to protect the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; aspects of 2i2c, if all the tech is open source?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c is to some extent committing to a limiting business model: by respecting the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
, we &lt;em>encourage&lt;/em> other organizations to perform the exact same kinds of services that 2i2c offers.
However, we believe this is in-line with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission, and would consider this to be a measure of impact rather than a sustainability problem.
In short: our goal is not to become a tech giant or start-up unicorn, we want to sustain a team with competitive pay, and we want to scale as there is more opportunity to serve new communities.
We believe that the complexity of integrating tools and managing cloud services means that there will always be enough of an opportunity to bring in ample funding for this model.
We also hope that our mission-driven nature and focus on research and education will bring in new kinds of funding opportunities that can sustain 2i2c and its mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-would-applying-the-1000-true-fans-approach-work-in-terms-of-advocacy">How would applying the &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; approach work in terms of advocacy?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1000 true fans&lt;/a>
approach suggests that it is enough to leverage the support of &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; to sustain a product or service.
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered 2i2c in this light before, but believe it aligns well with our strategy.
A common pattern 2i2c follows is to build connections with &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; in the communities that we wish to serve.
These individuals are passionate about open science, open source, and community-led workflows.
They advocate for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s services, and also serve as leaders for the kinds of workflows that 2i2c wishes to enable.
We believe that our mission-alignment with research and education, and our focus on empowering community leaders, will position us to build support and dedicated collaborators across these sectors.
We also hope that by centering Jupyter infrastructure in the services we offer, we can benefit from the recognition and demand for this ecosystem via our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-challenges-have-you-run-into-thus-far">What challenges have you run into thus far?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many things we could respond with here!
In this meeting, we discussed two major challenges we continue to iterate on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Walking the line between &amp;ldquo;software as a service&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;custom infrastructure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. 2i2c seeks to run infrastructure &lt;em>on behalf of&lt;/em> other communities, but in a scalable and sustainable way.
This means that we must centralize configuration and deployment, but use a standardized stack that benefits from economies of scale.
This is a complex problem, especially at the interface points with university bureacracies.
For example, many universities require a &lt;em>university email&lt;/em> in order to manage cloud infrastructure in their organization - doing this for each of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers is not a sustainable practice, and we must define creative ways to balance the security concerns of universities with our desire to run &lt;em>their&lt;/em> infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building a distributed organization from scratch&lt;/strong>. The other major challenge we&amp;rsquo;ve faced is simply the act of creating an organization from the ground up.
We have worked together for many years in open source communities, but there&amp;rsquo;s a new degree of complexity when you&amp;rsquo;re all working on the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> service and development efforts.
Throw in a largely asynchronous team split across many time zones, and there are a lot of coordination and planning challenges to overcome.
We have tried many things over the past year (see
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest team practices in the team compass&lt;/a>
, but there is still a lot of improvement to make.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-crucial-is-a-deep-seated-knowledge-of-jupyter-for-this-role">How crucial is a deep-seated knowledge of Jupyter for this role?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s not strictly required for somebody to have a knowledge of Jupyter, we think it will be an important part of this role (at least from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective).
This position is not an engineer, and won&amp;rsquo;t be expected to understand the inner-workings of Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.
However, it will be crucial that this role understand what is possible with JupyterHub, Notebooks, Jupyter Book, etc, and develop and teach best-practices in applying these tools for research and education.
They&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a deep &lt;em>intuition&lt;/em> for how to use Jupyter tools, how they should be improved, and how they can be integrated together for new services (along with other tools in the open source community).
More important than anything is a deep interest in this ecosystem, and a desire to learn, but having prior experience with the Jupyter stack and similar workflows will be a big benefit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-level-of-technical-expertise-is-needed-for-this-position">What level of technical expertise is needed for this position?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideally, they should have the expertise of a &amp;ldquo;power user&amp;rdquo; of the infrastructure and usecases that we work with.
We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this role to have software development or cloud infrastructure engineering expertise, but they should understand what it is like to &lt;strong>use&lt;/strong> these tools from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, and have an intuition about how to improve the workflows.
They should be able to communicate with and collaborate with engineers effectively, so understanding development workflows will be helpful, but they do not need core expertise in software development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-it-kind-of-like-a-scientific--technical-writer">Is it kind of like a scientific / technical writer?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The skills of a scientific or technical writer would certainly be relevant for this position.
For example, somebody that enjoyed technical documentation or scientific communication likely has one relevant skillset for this role.
However, the role will do much more than &lt;em>just&lt;/em> technical writing - they will also create and execute on organizational strategy, collaborate with our team around designing and planning our work, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-scientific-knowledge-in-a-specific-domain-important">Is scientific knowledge in a specific domain important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this person to have deep knowledge in any particular scientific field, though experience with scientific and educational workflows in general will be very beneficial.
2i2c&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build expertise in the aspects of interactive computing workflows that overlap between many research / educational communities.
We hope to work with leaders from these communities to leverage their domain expertise, and to empower them to lead others.
Similar to having technical expertise, the important thing is having an intuition for what it&amp;rsquo;s like to use the infrastructure, what &lt;em>kinds of problems&lt;/em> our target communities are trying to solve, and how to learn more about their perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-the-role-involve-writing-grants-for-the-sustainability-of-the-project">Does the role involve writing grants for the sustainability of the project?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This role isn&amp;rsquo;t tasked specifically with identifying and writing grants, though it is likely that they will collaborate with others at 2i2c in crafting grant language or pursuing similar opportunities.
2i2c is a small organization and so we all tend to wear many hats, though we try to keep each person&amp;rsquo;s efforts focused on their core responsibilities.
In this case, those responsibilities are community guidance and engagement, as well as service / product design in collaboration with our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-communications-would-this-role-oversee">What kinds of communications would this role oversee?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is hard to know right now and may evolve over time, but we expect this role will primarily communicate with pre-existing communities that we serve.
They will also foster communication between leaders within these communities.
They may interface with communities that 2i2c seeks to serve in the future (for example, in collaboration with sales and partnerships), but their focus will be on cultivating and guiding the communities we already work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="term-for-this-position">Term for this position&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We hire all team members on one-year contracts with an annual review and the expectation to renew the contract for another year (unless we explicitly say otherwise).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-are-the-communities-you-work-with">Where are the communities you work with?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here are a few characteristics of the communities we &lt;em>currently&lt;/em> work with, though we aspire to broaden this group significantly (for example, we wish to expand our focus outside of North American and Europe):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They tend to be focused in North America and in Europe (this is likely due to our pre-existing connections)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They cover a broad range of use-cases, from small- and large-scale education in single institutions, to small- and large-scale research communities that are distributed across the globe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A common pattern is to work with &amp;ldquo;community champions&amp;rdquo; that are interested in our technology and serve as leaders to bring these workflows to their respective communities. We seek to build more connections with people like this, and cultivate our relationship with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aspirationally, we hope to grow our reach to more communities outside of these countries, in order to achieve our mission of reaching a global audience.
Doing so will require more sophistication in our coordination and pricing, in order to match our services and support model with communities outside of North America and Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2i2c-is-young-and-without-much-structure-how-do-you-plan-to-add-more-structure-over-time-what-support-will-this-role-have">2i2c is young and without much structure. How do you plan to add more structure over time? What support will this role have?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is the first role of its kind, and so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with a relatively fluid environment.
We all believe strongly in building good organizational support structures, but we are a young organization that is still developing this capacity internally.
Your immediate primary support system will be the other strategic leadership of 2i2c - the Executive Director, Steering Council members (on an ad-hoc basis), and other team members.
Over time, we look forward to building more formal support networks between divisions of 2i2c and our team members.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-this-person-need-to-be-on-an-americaeurope-time-zone">Does this person need to be on an America/Europe time zone?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The team is currently distributed between US/Pacific and Eastern European time zones, and this also matches the majority of communities we currently work with, so it will be important for this person to have several hours overlap with at least one of those two (the more the better).
In the short run, it is likely that a person within these time zones will have the least barriers to team and community collaboration.
However, we do not have any strict rules about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the longer term, we are committed to building distributed team practices that do not cause team members to pay large penalties for being in a particular time zone, and we look forward to finding creative solutions to this challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-are-you-going-to-proceed-now-with-the-applications-youve-received">How are you going to proceed now with the applications you’ve received?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will soon begin reviewing applications on a rolling basis, and will aim for a multi-step interview process that is respectful of the time of each applicant.
More details to come about this, and we&amp;rsquo;ll start sending out communications about applications soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New job posting: Product and Community Lead.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/</guid><description>&lt;p>The 2i2c team is looking to hire a new team member! We are seeking a product and community lead with the following two goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Empower the communities we serve to have impact with our infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guide our development and service design to reflect the needs of our users.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This role will work alongside our engineering team as a partner, and will serve as a high-bandwidth interface to the communities that we work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a link to the full job posting below, the rest of this post is a short rationale for this role, and how we hope it will fit within 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team and strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul class="cta-group">

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-new-role">Why a new role?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When 2i2c began a year ago, we hired a team of engineers that had experience in cloud infrastructure, Jupyter, and open source ecosystems. In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve built out the infrastructure foundation for scalable interactive computing environments that are customizable for the community, and respects their
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/content/right-to-replicate/">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, solely providing infrastructure is not enough. Working with the modern open source stack, using the cloud to its advantage, and bringing these tools into specific domains requires a lot of extra experience and expertise. We believe that 2i2c is in a good position to &lt;strong>provide guidance and support to leaders in the communities that we serve&lt;/strong>, allowing them to get up-to-speed with the infrastructure more effectively so that they can have an impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned that it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to &lt;strong>develop infrastructure in collaboration with the communities that we&amp;rsquo;re serving&lt;/strong>. A team of engineers tends to focus on code and infrastructure, and having a role that focuses on connecting with communities will give them an excellent perspective on what those communities need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this role will combine these two aspects to create a culture of learning, sharing, and guiding between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team and the communities that we work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-similar-roles">What are similar roles?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We tried to find similar roles in the private and non-profit sector, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that was a perfect fit. However, there were a few close matches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is kind-of like a &lt;strong>product manager&lt;/strong> - their job is to understand the communities that we work with, and to use this to help us make decisions about what to build, how to present it, and how to engage with stakeholders. They will need to help us prioritize the work that is most impactful for our mission, and help us navigate trade-offs in the evolution of our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is also kind-of like a &lt;strong>customer success manager&lt;/strong> or a &lt;strong>developer advocate&lt;/strong> - they will guide and teach those in the communities we serve - particularly community leaders that go on to teach others - how to use our infrastructure most-effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, the closest role we could find is a relatively new one: the
&lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Research Applications Manager&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
. This is a role that has been pioneered by the Turing Institute, and is similarly described as a connector that brings together many perspectives and encourages a participatory, team-based approach to research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the reality is that the person in this role will ultimately get to shape the nature of their work within 2i2c. As a young organization, there is a lot of flexibility for creativity and experimentation in bringing new skillsets into our organization. We hope that the person who fills this role will be excited about growing a culture of team-based approaches to our engineering and collaborations, and to share this culture with the communities that we serve.&lt;/p>

In this year we have grown, experimented, and accomplished a lot - we have also faced challenges and learned as a team. Our primary goal in 2021 was to build a strong foundation for 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reflect on our work thus far, we&amp;rsquo;re writing three blog posts that describe progress in major areas of work towards this foundation for 2i2c.
These three areas are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Creating services for use-cases&lt;/strong> - these are our first managed infrastructure offerings for communities in research and education.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Developing cloud infrastructure and tools&lt;/strong> - this is the technical backbone that makes these services possible, built entirely on open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building an organizational foundation&lt;/strong> - this is the creation of our team structures, processes, and culture that help us carry out our mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This first post will focus on &lt;strong>services that we&amp;rsquo;ve created in our first year&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission is to facilitate use-cases in research and education via open source development and services. Throughout 2021 we ran several pilots to learn more about the needs of communities in research and education, and how we could build sustainable services that meet these needs. Here are some highlights for each major use-case we have targeted thus far:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="educational-community-hubs">Educational community hubs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A primary use-case that 2i2c seeks to enable is &lt;strong>collaborative, distributed educational spaces for learning with data&lt;/strong>. In 2021 we ran several pilots with educational communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A university-wide hub for the University of Toronto.&lt;/strong> This hub is used in a variety of classes throughout the university, and is made freely available to anyone with a UofT account. We hope to repeat this model for other university-wide communities, and have learned a lot about the challenges of working with particularly large educational communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Several hubs for community colleges across California.&lt;/strong> In partnership with UC Berkeley and CloudBank, we&amp;rsquo;ve run several hubs for nearly a dozen small community colleges teaching the
&lt;a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data 8 curriculum&lt;/a>
for their students. These hubs are lightweight and offer standardized environments for their students to use, in order to lower the cost of deploying and maintaining the hubs over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned">What we learned&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The organizational context around educational use-cases is different from research communities. Compared with research groups, educucational groups have more variance in their size (classes as small as 10 people and as large as 500) and think about cost &lt;strong>by the student&lt;/strong>, not as a lump sum. This means that our initial hub-based pricing model may not map cleanly onto educational contexts, and we need to improve the match of scalability and price to these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that for these communities, navigating all of the open source tools that are available for pedagogy is confusing! Everybody wants auto-grading but it&amp;rsquo;s unclear what is the &amp;ldquo;right tool for the job&amp;rdquo;. Tools like
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nbgitpuller&lt;/a>
have heavy use at &amp;ldquo;power universities&amp;rdquo; like UC Berkeley, but many others don&amp;rsquo;t know that it exists! We will need to invest more time into building guides and documentation that help others leverage these tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="research-in-the-cloud">Research in the cloud&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to educational use-cases, we ran several pilots for research communities in order to leverage cloud infrastructure for scaling their work or collaborating more effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We migrated Pangeo’s cloud infrastructure to be run via 2i2c.&lt;/strong> The
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Community&lt;/a>
had been operating and developing their own JupyterHub for several years, but were looking for another organization to provide more reliable/sustained operations and support for their Pangeo Cloud Service. This year we migrated the service
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/pangeo-goes-live/">to run off of 2i2c’s deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A scalable cloud hub for a SWOT satellite team&lt;/strong>. The
&lt;a href="https://meom-group.github.io/projects/swot-st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEOM research group at Grenoble&lt;/a>
is doing work with the
&lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA SWOT satellite project&lt;/a>
. However, the datasets generated from this project are huge, and only storable via the cloud. We&amp;rsquo;ve set up a JupyterHub to provide cloud-based access to this data, running a Pangeo-like environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-1">What we learned&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Research communities tend to have more usecase-specific needs than educational ones. While introductory courses in data science tend to be similar across institutions, research needs are much more unique to the problem and team at hand. Moreover, they tend to want infrastructure that runs via institutional cloud accounts. This is possible due to the flexible nature of Jupyter and JupyterHub, but brings extra challenges in bureacracy and access permissions, given that 2i2c engineers usually are not members of these organizations already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, many research use-cases are based around the &lt;strong>location of the data&lt;/strong>. This is because data is the hardest thing to move from cloud to cloud. For this reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important to &lt;strong>bring interactive sessions to the data&lt;/strong>. Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem makes this possible, but we&amp;rsquo;d like to do more to make this easier. For example, users should be able to launch interactive sessions across many clusters or datacenters, regardless of their hub&amp;rsquo;s location. They should also have more customized control over their environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="distributed-events-and-hackweeks">Distributed events and hackweeks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally, we had a special use-case that is a hybrid of the previous two examples. Events and hackweeks are &lt;em>time-bounded&lt;/em>, &lt;em>focused on learning and doing&lt;/em>, but often &lt;em>with research workflows and communities&lt;/em>. They also tend to be more globally-distributed than a traditional research or education community.
See below for a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://coessing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
workshop is a summer school run in Ghana to share skills and workflows with researchers across Africa. It builds on workflows in the Pangeo ecosystem, and teaches attendees how to work with cloud-native data. By using a cloud-based JupyterHub for their workshop, attendees had direct access to data and compute in a way that would have been much more difficult to set up on local infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://linked.earth/paleoHackathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>PaleoHackWeek hackathons&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
were two hackathons around paleo/climate data workflows. They brought together a distributed community and use the 2i2c hub to facilitate the use of the
&lt;a href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paleoclim package&lt;/a>
throughout the hackweek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.openscapes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>OpenScapes&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. They have several cohorts of scientific trainees learning more about adopting open and collaborative workflows, and use a hub managed by 2i2c to provide remote learning environments for their workshops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-2">What we learned&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Initially we assumed that event-based hubs would be similar to educational use-cases. However, in practice they are more complex. First, event organizers have ever-changing communities of users on their hubs. They often want to provide access to many new users in each event, and expect only a small subset to continue using the infrastructure after an event. Finally, one-off events also generate spikes in activity that are more intense than educational use-cases, and warrant more dedicated attention from our engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-that-we-faced">Challenges that we faced&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we piloted these use-cases, we also ran into a few challenges in designing services around our infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Balancing standard deployments, custom deployments, and scalability&lt;/strong>. Our goal is to centralize our deployment and operations infrastructure in order to reduce the maintenance burden for each community hub. This will allow us to gain economies of scale and lower costs. However, there’s an inherent tension between scalability and customizability - in order to scale we must standardize the infrastructure we offer, but communities often want environments that are unique to their use-case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Turning services into sustainability&lt;/strong>. We’ve learned that charging money for things does not come naturally to us. We’ve spent many years building technology and services that were offered freely to the public. This was easy to provide, but difficult to sustain. 2i2c’s goal is to offer similar services, but with a sustainability model that allows us to employ team members to do this work, and to grow in the future. Understanding how to pair the right technology, use-case, and service with a particular pricing model is an area where we must learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What’s next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Piloting all of these services taught us a lot about the similarities and differences between each use case. Towards the end of 2021, this led to 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first collection of &amp;ldquo;service offerings&amp;rdquo; for a Managed Jupyter Service. This includes a 2-by-2 matrix of service options, and a specific price point for each. We have begun offering this service to communities, in order to learn more about the model, the pricing, and any changes that should be made. In early 2022, we hope to expand this group to more communities so that we can test this model’s ability to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our next post in this series will focus on the underlying technology that powers the services described above, stay tuned for more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Community update Q3 2021: A new fiscal sponsor, improving our infrastructure, nearing an alpha launch.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we&amp;rsquo;re up to next. In addition, almost all of the work we do is public and discoverable across
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our GitHub repositories&lt;/a>
, and is tracked by GitHub issues.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=org:2i2c-org&amp;#43;type:issue&amp;#43;is:closed&amp;#43;closed:2021-06-01..2021-10-01&amp;#43;-label:%22type:&amp;#43;team-sync%22&amp;#43;is:issue&amp;amp;type=issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of issues we&amp;rsquo;ve closed in ~Q3&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is amazing how quickly 4 months goes by when you&amp;rsquo;re building an organization from scratch! It seems like only a few weeks ago that we were recapping the beginning of the year in
&lt;a href="../six-month-update">our last community update&lt;/a>
. Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we&amp;rsquo;ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover major highlights, challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced, and where we&amp;rsquo;re going next.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="managed-jupyterhub-service">Managed JupyterHub Service&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we&amp;rsquo;ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation across cloud providers&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS&lt;/a>
as well as
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure&lt;/a>
to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Monitoring and reporting infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We have worked on the JupyterHub
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>grafana-dashboards&lt;/code> project&lt;/a>
to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User environment management&lt;/strong>. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve improved the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker GitHub action&lt;/a>
to work with more image registries, and created a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/hub-user-image-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c user image template repository&lt;/a>
for users to re-use for their hubs. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/admin/howto/environment.html#bring-your-own-docker-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the User Environment docs&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support and collaboration roles&lt;/strong>. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the &lt;strong>community representative&lt;/strong> role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the user roles documentation&lt;/a>
for more information. We have also begun prototyping a
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshDesk support model&lt;/a>
and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pangeo">Pangeo&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are working with &lt;strong>the Pangeo Community&lt;/strong> to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work

&lt;p>We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the
&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executable Books Project&lt;/a>
. As such, we have begun shifting our attention to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for sustaining the project&amp;rsquo;s community beyond this grant&lt;/a>
. In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Finally, in addition to our major development and projects, we have also made a lot of progress at an organizational level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>began
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/css-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fiscal sponsorship with Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This provides a new organizational and legal home for 2i2c after spending nearly a year receiving
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical strategic and start-up support&lt;/a>
from our previous host,
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICSI&lt;/a>
. We are excited to work with CS&amp;amp;S to create the business infrastructure that will power our managed JupyterHubs service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2i2c team has also been &lt;strong>improving our team planning and coordination processes&lt;/strong>, so that we can more effectively execute on our mission. As a distributed team, we have the challenge of building processes for team communication, coordination, and planning that are distributed and asynchronous. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you can learn more about our coordination processes in
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have &lt;strong>improved our organization-wide documentation&lt;/strong> in order to make it easier to navigate between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s various sources of information. We hope that this provides more transparency into what 2i2c is up to and how it is structured, and that it allows us to build more connections between our projects and the broader community. Check out the new documentation landing site at
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs.2i2c.org&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to making iterative improvements around the projects described above, we have a few major goals for the final quarter of 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>polish and finish the alpha-level deployment infrastructure&lt;/strong> across each of the major cloud providers. Our end goal is to be able to &lt;em>deploy a Kubernetes cluster and a JupyterHub on that cluster with minimal human effort&lt;/em>. This will allow us to serve more communities with fewer human effort per community. This includes migrating JupyterHubs for key communities, such as the Pangeo project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define and begin an alpha-level service&lt;/strong>. This means defining a few specific &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; that 2i2c can offer, as well as a pricing model for each product. Our goals will still be to learn about how this service should evolve, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more specificity about ways that others can engage with us. It will also be an opportunity to scale modestly so that we can improve our infrastructure as-needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define a longer-term vision&lt;/strong> for our Managed JupyterHubs Service, and create a plan for new workflows that we wish to enable via new development. We wish to use our experience in managing JupyterHubs to understand where new open source development would significantly help the communities we serve, and will shift our attention in this direction once we have finished the early stages of making our infrastructure more robust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for some more updates about this service, coming soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-weve-faced">Challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally, we want to recognize that there are plenty of challenges along with successes when it comes to having impact! Here are a few of the unexpected challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve faced along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developing and operating multi-cloud infrastructure is a complex process&lt;/strong>. Automating the creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters across each of the major cloud providers has proven to be a lot of work! While it has been necessary to use our pre-existing hubs to provide the opportunity to build this infrastructure, it is a challenge to both &lt;em>build&lt;/em> and &lt;em>operate&lt;/em> infrastructure at the same time. This has lengthened our timelines for when we expect the alpha version of the service to be ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coordinating among a distributed team takes time&lt;/strong>. Each of our team members has been used to working asynchronously with open source communities for many years, and we under-estimated how complex it would be to port this workflow to a distributed team that must coordinate with each other much more closely on a daily basis. Deciding what to work on, how to work on it, and how to help one another take a lot of work when you only share a few hours awake at the same time. For this reason, we have spent a lot of extra energy in our first months as a team to work out
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team processes for coordination and collaboration&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to design cloud services as a non-profit?&lt;/strong> Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is no clear roadmap for how to build a sustainable cloud service like the one we describe here. 2i2c is somewhere in-between a traditional SaaS company (which tends to provide access to proprietary technology) and a bespoke consultancy (which is more hands-on and custom than we are). Our best explanation for what 2i2c wishes to do is &amp;ldquo;Open source operations/dev-ops as a service&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into either category. This means that we have more &amp;ldquo;unknown unknowns&amp;rdquo; about what kind of service and pricing model we should develop. We hope to begin answering some of these questions in our alpha-level service launch. Stay tuned for more to come!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="get-involved">Get involved&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thanks for your interest in 2i2c and the mission that it hopes to accomplish.

&lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>CS&amp;amp;S blog&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code for Science &amp;amp; Society is thrilled to welcome the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/a>
(2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project! After spending a year incubating in the
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>
, where 2i2c
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received critical startup support&lt;/a>
, 2i2c now joins our fiscally sponsored project program to launch their next phase. 2i2c develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing, with a focus on the Jupyter ecosystem and cloud-native workflows in research and education. They will build a cloud services model that respects a community’s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate their infrastructure&lt;/a>
by providing transparent and customizable JupyterHub deployments on cloud infrastructure that utilize community-driven open source tools. They aim to use the resources generated from this service in order to support the communities that underlie this infrastructure. Read on for more about 2i2c’s mission and how CS&amp;amp;S will support their team and vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c’s organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2c’s co-founders have co-led for many years, including
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder Project&lt;/a>
, and the
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/a>
. These projects follow an “integrate, customize, and upstream” model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CS&amp;amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS&amp;amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS&amp;amp;S’s other initiatives in this space, including CS&amp;amp;S’s other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the
&lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/cs-s-launches-digital-infrastructure-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Infrastructure Incubator program&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Achieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2c’s next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2c’s developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="../czi-core-support">funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>
).
In that time we&amp;rsquo;ve made progress along several directions, and wish to use this blog post to provide updates about the ways in which 2i2c has evolved over the first months of its existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few major updates from the 2i2c community - as always, if you want to learn more about 2i2c, keep an eye
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts">on our blog&lt;/a>
or subscribe to the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/#contact">2i2c mailing list&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="early-pilot-jupyterhub-infrastructure">Early pilot JupyterHub infrastructure&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>First off - we have been making progress building out our JupyterHub deployment infrastructure for 2i2c.
One of our major organizational goals is to build a sustainable service
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure">managing open source cloud infrastructure&lt;/a>
for interactive computing.
This service will provide hosted, customized JupyterHubs for communities of practice in research and education.
They&amp;rsquo;ll be built entirely with open source tools that are community-driven, and that
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">respect the customer&amp;rsquo;s Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to accomplish this, 2i2c is running several pilots with partners and interested organizations, supported by our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/czi-core-support">funding from CZI&lt;/a>
, as well as from
&lt;a href="https://investinopen.org/blog/jrost-rapid-response-fund-awardees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the JROST rapid response fund&lt;/a>
.
These pilots are meant to be learning opportunities to understand what kind of infrastructure and service it needs to build moving forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation for our pilot hubs infrastructure&lt;/a>
contains information about our deployments and infrastructure.
It is served from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this &lt;code>2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/code> repository&lt;/a>
, a centralized location for configuring and deploying a federated network of JupyterHubs.
Each JupyterHub is independent of one another, and could be spun out from the centralized repository with minimal extra work, giving hub users the ability to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">replicate their infrastructure, with or without 2i2c&lt;/a>
.
We will continue refining the code in this repository as we learn more from our hub infrastructure pilots.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhub-for-geospatial-analytics---a-collaboration-with-pangeo">JupyterHub for geospatial analytics - A collaboration with Pangeo&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/pangeo/pangeo-2-0-2bedf099582d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally announced on the Pangeo blog&lt;/a>
, 2i2c is forging a collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo project&lt;/a>
around operating and developing cloud infrastructure for large-scale geospatial analytics!
This collaboration is funded through a grant from the Moore Foundation (via Pangeo investigator Ryan Abernathey).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the coming months, 2i2c plans to assume operation of infrastructure underlying the Pangeo project, allowing the Pangeo team to focus their efforts on their core scientific and development missions.
Because Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure is already running on a fully open source stack with JupyterHub, our first step will simply be to shift control over this infrastructure to 2i2c engineers.
We don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate needing to make major changes to their infrastructure and deployments (part of the benefits of using open, modular tools).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once this is complete, we&amp;rsquo;ll next shift our attention to some new areas of development that support use-cases in the Pangeo community (and in the scientific community more broadly).
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of progress that we imagine making - such as
&lt;a href="https://gallery.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting publishing pipelines via the Pangeo Gallery&lt;/a>
or improving tools for scalable computing with
&lt;a href="https://gateway.dask.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dask Gateway&lt;/a>
.
We&amp;rsquo;ll provide updates as we formally begin this collaboration and hash out a plan for our next steps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhub-for-education---a-collaboration-with-cloudbank-and-uc-berkeley">JupyterHub for education - A collaboration with CloudBank and UC Berkeley&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership with the UC Berkeley
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Science in Undergraduate Studies program&lt;/a>
, as well as
&lt;a href="http://cloudbank.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudBank&lt;/a>
.
This collaboration aims to provide hosted JupyterHub infrastructure for community colleges across the state of California.
It is an attempt at providing vendor-agnostic and open-source infrastructure to several institutions who would otherwise not be able to deploy this infrastructure on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will provide the deployment and configuration architecture for this collaboration, working with
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-morris-5847aa2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Morris&lt;/a>
in operating this educational infrastructure.
All of the cloud infrastructure for this pilot will be funded via CloudBank.
We will begin by offering environments that are modeled after
&lt;a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Data 8 course at UC Berkeley&lt;/a>
.
This is part of an effort to build a community of practice around Data Science education using open source tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-team-members">New team members&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also welcomed two new members to the 2i2c core team! 🎉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These individuals will both work towards
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/projects">2i2c&amp;rsquo;s major projects&lt;/a>
, and collaborate together on running our 2i2c Pilot Hub infrastructure.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a bit about each new team member.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/damianavila" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damián Avila&lt;/a>
. Damián has been a Jupyter core team member for many years now, and has done work across many different parts of the PyData stack (in particular,
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="http://bokeh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bokeh&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://rise.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RISE&lt;/a>
, and
&lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikola&lt;/a>
). Damián will focus his efforts on supporting JupyterHub infrastructure for the
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo project&lt;/a>
, as well as development across the
&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executable Books Project&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sgibson91" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Gibson&lt;/a>
. Sarah will join 2i2c in June, after spending several years as a Research Software Engineer at
&lt;a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Turing Institute&lt;/a>
. She has also been involved with
&lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Turing Way&lt;/a>
for many years. Sarah will focus her efforts on JupyterHub development and operations for the Pangeo community.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="governance-and-a-code-of-conduct">Governance and a code of conduct&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally, while it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in technology and collaborations, 2i2c has also made important steps towards defining a stable and transparent organizational model moving forward.
2i2c now
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/structure.html#steering-council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a Steering Council&lt;/a>
and an
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/structure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early organizational structure&lt;/a>
.
In addition,
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we&amp;rsquo;ve defined a one-year bootstrap strategy&lt;/a>
that we&amp;rsquo;ll use to guide our path in the first year of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, one of the first acts of the Steering Council has been to
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/code-of-conduct/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopt a Code of Conduct&lt;/a>
.
This is a set of guidelines, and a process for resolving incidents, that makes our community more inclusive, equitable, and enjoyable for all.
Creating a Code of Conduct is a crucial part of defining our organizational and community culture, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to have some explicit guidelines to support our interactions in the future!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="keep-in-touch">Keep in touch&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Now that we are improving our organizational foundation, we will try to post more frequent updates and discussions about what we are up to.
We hope for 2i2c to be a model organization in participatory, collaborative, transparent operations, and we look forward to working with you all in the future on this journey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2i2c receives core support from CZI</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/czi-core-support/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/czi-core-support/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last week we
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/hello-world/">announced the creation of 2i2c&lt;/a>
, a non-profit initiative dedicated to improving and facilitating access to infrastructure for interactive computing workflows in research and education. Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>
. You can find

.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of this post is a short run-down of what we&amp;rsquo;ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-big-picture">The big picture&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In recent years, several projects including
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy&lt;/a>
, and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Berkeley DataHubs&lt;/a>
have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are two keys goals for this grant:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">Goal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/chris-holdgraf">Chris Holdgraf&lt;/a>
to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">Goal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c will offer hosted
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure">interactive computing infrastructure&lt;/a>
utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first hire -
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/georgiana-dolocan">Georgiana Dolocan&lt;/a>
as an &lt;strong>Open Source Infrastructure Engineer&lt;/strong>. Georgiana has been the
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/the-jupyterhub-and-binder-contributor-in-residence-56708d1e3069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub Contributor in Residence&lt;/a>
for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Georgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/outreachy-jupyter-supporting-diversity-in-open-communities-dfa78db4b0bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an outreachy internship&lt;/a>
followed by
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/cir-report-i-1ca418c230cd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a term as Contributor in Residence&lt;/a>
. Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the
&lt;a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkeley Institute for Data Science&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://numfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NumFOCUS&lt;/a>
for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the

&lt;p>With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure/#kinds-of-hubs">JupyterHub pilot deployments&lt;/a>
to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please
&lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">reach out to 2i2c&lt;/a>
and let us know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally. We also believe it will lead to major advancements in supporting interactive computing workflows for research and education. We look forward to what the next three years will bring!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>👋 hey everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the creation of a new non-profit organization&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that we call &lt;strong>2i2c&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c stands for &lt;strong>The International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/strong>. It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out

at JupyterCon 2020:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="why-create-2i2c">Why create 2i2c?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/founders#datahub">bringing data science education to thousands of students&lt;/a>
, connecting
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/founders#pangeo">geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud&lt;/a>
, and providing
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/founders#syzygy">federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada&lt;/a>
, to name a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that &lt;em>development&lt;/em> and &lt;em>support&lt;/em> of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-non-profit">Why a non-profit?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>It may sound strange to create a non-profit initiative when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research and educational communities&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Researchers and educators who need development&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that offers development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source communities&lt;/strong>, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud providers&lt;/strong>, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supporters of open source&lt;/strong> who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-going-to-do">What are we going to do?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here&amp;rsquo;s a rough picture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Offer
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure">&lt;strong>hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
. These will
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">be entirely open source&lt;/a>
and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They&amp;rsquo;ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">the 2i2c &lt;strong>Right to Replicate&lt;/strong> document&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure#research-development-hubs">&lt;strong>collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
. Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community&amp;rsquo;s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/#jupyter">&lt;strong>core development and community support&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
for open source projects that we use. While many organizations &lt;em>use&lt;/em> Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they &lt;em>give back&lt;/em> to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-steps">Next steps&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months. Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be up to next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first step is to &lt;strong>understand how interactive computing can best-serve the research and education communities&lt;/strong>. We know that interactive computing tools work in our specific use-cases, but how do these generalize to other domains or types of organizations? Moreover, how can we improve the open source tools to make them even more customizable for each community?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll begin answering this question through several focused JupyterHub pilots aimed at different use-cases across research and education:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A &amp;ldquo;Hubs for All&amp;rdquo; pilot for education&lt;/strong>. This will focus on making standard educational environments via JupyterHub accessible to a broad range of educational institutions, in particular, traditionally under-resourced institutions such as community colleges, state colleges, and HBCUs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research-focused hubs for earth analytics&lt;/strong>. Research requires more complex and customized infrastructure than education, and so we are piloting hub infrastructure for a few specific research communities to understand how we can meet their needs. We will use this to better-understand how 2i2c and support a diverse research community in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JupyterHub development for the Pangeo Project&lt;/strong>. Pangeo has been a collaborator of 2i2c since day one, and we love its vision for large-scale earth analytics via cloud infrastructure. We plan to work closely with Pangeo leadership to work on early development of tools aimed at facilitating scalable computing for research on Pangeo infrastructure. More information about this to come soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll also use these pilots to &lt;strong>develop an organizational sustainability model&lt;/strong> around this infrastructure. It takes expertise to manage and develop cloud infrastructure, and 2i2c wishes to pay market rates for its engineers. How can 2i2c offer services and development in a way that is sustainable both for itself and for other institutions? We&amp;rsquo;ll use these pilots to create a plan for both sustaining and scaling 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s ability to serve institutions and teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-we-need">What do we need?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c has a long road ahead of it. We cannot take venture capital funding, so we have to raise funds the old-fashioned way. This means that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;h2 id="wrapping-up">Wrapping up&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are excited about 2i2c, and believe that it is the right kind of organization to create to support research and education, as well as open source communities in interactive computing. The road ahead is a difficult one, but we&amp;rsquo;re confident that we will hit our stride quickly. Stay tuned for more updates to come.&lt;/p>
