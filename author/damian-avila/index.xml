&lt;h2 id="who-we-are">Who we are&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c is a non-profit organization with a mission to make interactive computing more accessible, scalable, and powerful for research and education:
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/about">https://2i2c.org/about/&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We accomplish this mission by providing managed cloud services for interactive computing, by providing development and technical leadership to researchers and educators that utilize this infrastructure for specific communities, and by providing support for open source tools and communities in this ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have deep ties to the open source community, and have been leaders and core contributors across dozens of projects - in particular in the Jupyter ecosystem. We also have deep ties to research and education - our team has spent years deploying infrastructure for universities, community colleges, and research teams, and now we’re bringing this experience to a wider audience with 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe strongly in communities that are inclusive, transparent, equitable, effective, and diverse, especially 2i2c itself. We believe that our values should permeate everything about 2i2c, including the work we do, the communities we serve, and our own organizational culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is a fiscally sponsored project of
&lt;a href="http://www.codeforsociety.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
, a registered US 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-youll-do">What you’ll do&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>

&lt;li>Address support issues&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Explore emerging technologies in the Cloud / DevOps space, design and implement cloud computing architecture in partnership with our team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Participate in upstream open source communities we rely on (such as JupyterHub, BinderHub, Dask, etc) in partnership with the established leaders of those communities and collaborate with the Community Lead in the education and outreach around cloud computing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Work with a distributed and global team - team members are given a lot of autonomy, and expected to be proactive at communicating with one another and working with others to allocate effort that will maximize our impact.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="essential-requirements">Essential requirements&lt;/h2>

&lt;li>Experience developing tools in a general purpose programming language (eg. Python).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience collaborating and coordinating work via online platforms, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket, and distributed revision control.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience working with distributed service teams that use asynchronous methods of communication&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Evidence of existing connections and relationships in the worldwide ecosystem of open source software for data-intensive research and ability to establish new ones.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience with common data science methods, platforms, workflows, and infrastructures; with data management systems, practices, and standards; and the capacity to gain familiarity with new related topics.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience engaging with highly technical researchers across a variety of methodological fields, research domains, and computational platforms.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience building and maintaining continuous deployment pipelines.&lt;/li>
