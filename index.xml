While this usually isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal, it means that there is a missed opportunity to grow the impact of an ecosystem because it requires coordinated development among multiple stakeholders within it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of the reasons we created 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s open community hub platform. By deploying a single platform that utilizes entirely open infrastructure that we contribute back to, we have visibility over a variety of projects along with the need to combine them together for a specific end-user outcome. One-such development scenario recently came up involving
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Allowing readers to &amp;ldquo;bring their own Binders&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#allowing-readers-to-bring-their-own-binders">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working to integrate
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> workflows with our community hubs for a more seamless experience (for example, having book pages link back to interactive cloud sessions that allow users to interact with the content). We imagine a network of Jupyter Books that all build upon the same core infrastructures (JupyterHub, Binder, etc) for cloud-based computing. Our hope is to allow a user to &lt;em>bring their own Binder&lt;/em> with them so that they can interact with another book&amp;rsquo;s content with their own cloud infrastructure. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A student with access to &lt;code>binder.myuniversity.edu&lt;/code> could read a Jupyter Book created by a professor at &lt;code>otheruniversity.edu&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Jupyter Book is defined with a
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder specification&lt;/a> that has a recipe for re-building the environment needed to run te book&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the professor&amp;rsquo;s book, the student can choose to launch an interactive Binder sessions on &lt;em>their university&amp;rsquo;s Binder&lt;/em>, allowing them to interact with the book&amp;rsquo;s content on their own infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We want a workflow like this to be as seamless and un-complicated as possible. We also want it to follow the same fundamental workflow as the
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/community/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller-based launch buttons&lt;/a>. Along the way, we realized that we needed to coordinate development across
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a>],
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Getting Jupyter Book to discover Jupyter Hub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-jupyter-book-to-discover-jupyter-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As we began developing this workflow, we realized that there was a blocker in the JupyterHub and BinderHub ecosystem that needed to be fixed. We needed a way to &lt;strong>ask a JupyterHub whether it had an unauthenticated end-point for service discovery&lt;/strong>. Basically, a way to ask a hub &amp;ldquo;what kind of hub are you, and how can we launch an interactive session on you?&amp;rdquo; Doing this is simple-enough - JupyterHub already has a way of reporting its version and application type, which allows us to infer how to launch interactive sessions. But, we hit a snag in an HTML context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, JupyterHub disallows certain kinds of
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&lt;/a> (CORS) requests, in order to restrict other applications from abusing a JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API. If you hit parts of a JupyterHub API from &lt;em>the command line&lt;/em>, things work fine. But if you do the same thing via JavaScript from a website, the request is disallowed. This was a problem if we want Jupyter Book (a web application) to be able to make requests of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we realized that we needed to make an &lt;strong>upstream contribution in JupyterHub&lt;/strong> in order to &lt;strong>enable an interaction between JupyterHub and Jupyter Book&lt;/strong>. In this case, it was a relatively simple fix: allowing CORS requests for the specific API endpoint we needed (which is a very lightweight endpoint that is not vulnerable to security risks, and is broadly useful to make accessible)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. That resulted in two PRs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4966" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/jupyterhub#4966&lt;/a> allows CORS requests for the API that was needed for service discovery in JupyterHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/binderhub#1906&lt;/a> enables this workflow on a BinderHub so that its services can be discovered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/pull/503" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyter-book/myst-theme#503&lt;/a> adds new launch button functionality to
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> that allows readers to bring their own Binder / JupyterHub links for launching. (this is what necessitated the above two PRs)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a result of this upstream contribution loop, JupyterHub can now accept API requests at its &amp;ldquo;service discovery&amp;rdquo; endpoint, which means that Jupyter Book (and any other web application) can more easily learn about a hub&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to share this short vignette because it&amp;rsquo;s a good reflection of the kind of value that 2i2c tries to provide, given its role in helping to build and enhance networks of infrastructure, domain communities, and open source communities. In this case, we enabled a &lt;em>cross-project&lt;/em> workflow that required knowledge of each project, and a vision for how they could be used together in a way that exceeded the sum of their parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more potential in these kinds of workflows, and are eager to continue our work to identify and enhance community-centric infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>This actually required an interesting bit of team discussion that was much easier with a few 2i2c staff on the JupyterHub team. The original request from Angus was interpreted as opening up the &lt;em>entire hub API&lt;/em> to external requests (which is a bad idea!) but we were able to quickly discuss this with the JupyterHub team to clarify that this was only about a very specific API endpoint. This is the kind of communication loop that often goes haywire when you have people contributing to a project without historical relationships to the project&amp;rsquo;s maintainers.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/open-technology/" >Commitment to Open Technology&lt;/a>. It is focused on &lt;em>software licenses&lt;/em> for reasons we&amp;rsquo;ll describe below. We hope that it clarifies what kind of licenses we&amp;rsquo;ll use, and assures our communities that we will not change our stance towards open source technology in the future. This ensures 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s long-term commitment to community-owned and open infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Being a platform and service provider gives us a lot of power, and also introduces a potential source of &lt;em>lock-in&lt;/em> for our member communities. While 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational mission and culture are strongly aligned with open infrastructure, we believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to encode commitments like these in a formal way to provide both transparency and accountability to our member communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>All engineering artifacts (code, documentation, etc) produced by 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineering team MUST be licensed under an open source license approved by a non-profit organization that is not 2i2c.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Source Projects originating at 2i2c, or stewarded by 2i2c, MUST NOT require a

&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-commitment-mean">
What does this commitment mean?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-this-commitment-mean">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In plain language, here&amp;rsquo;s what this commitment means:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;ll only use open source licenses that have been approved by standard non-profits that are broadly recognized by the tech industry.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>For anything we build, we won&amp;rsquo;t require contributors to give up the rights to their contributions via CLAs, so that it is much harder for 2i2c to change our licenses in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changing this policy will require organization-wide agreement, and in the future we&amp;rsquo;ll give authority over this policy to a group of people representing our member communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="why-are-licenses-and-clas-important">
Why are licenses and CLAs important?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-are-licenses-and-clas-important">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Many organizations claim to be committed to open infrastructure, while retaining the ability to &lt;em>change this commitment in the future when it is in their interests&lt;/em>. A classic example of this is a &amp;ldquo;bait and switch&amp;rdquo; that looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>A company releases software under an open source license and professes to build an open source community around it.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>However, they retain the rights to all of the code in their projects through a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Contributor License Agreement&lt;/a> (CLA) with copyright assignment. This generally means that contributors must &lt;em>give up the rights to their contribution&lt;/em> in order to make that contribution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Once their product has gained traction and it is in their interests, the company can &lt;em>change the license&lt;/em> to whatever they wish (even one that is not open source) because they retain the rights to all contributions in the codebase.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They then leverage this new position as owners of a proprietary project to extract business value or grow their position in a market.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Think this sounds unlikely? Here are just a few recent examples of companies that have switched their license after many years of releasing their technology under an open source license:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://redis.io/blog/redis-adopts-dual-source-available-licensing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Redis&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/blog/hashicorp-adopts-business-source-license" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hashicorp / Terraform&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch#Licensing_changes" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Elastic Search&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We want to ensure our communities that 2i2c is not headed down this path, in order to give them confidence in treating us as a long-term service partner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-this-change-about-2i2cs-open-source-commitment">
What does this change about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s open source commitment?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-this-change-about-2i2cs-open-source-commitment">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In short: nothing. These are already the principles that 2i2c was committed to from its inception, and already implied via our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a>. However, we wanted to make these commitments more formally in order to give ourselves more accountability to sticking with them, and to provide more transparency for our community members and stakeholders.&lt;/p>

Who is this for?

&lt;li>&lt;strong>2i2c present and future staff&lt;/strong> who want to ensure that their organization remains committed to our open principles. This document provides a sense of psychological safety to have bold discussions about structuring our approach to open source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Member communities and 2i2c stakeholders&lt;/strong> who need to have an understanding of the guarantees that we provide in order to trust 2i2c as a service developer and provider. This is similar to the effect our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a> has.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source communities&lt;/strong> who need to understand our long-term commitment and goals around open technology in order to trust as a peer and collaborator within open source communities.&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://sgibson91.github.io/cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sarah Gibson&lt;/a> have been leading this project for the last few months. Since we are moving away from
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >AWS Managed EFS&lt;/a> here, we had to do some work to recreate some of the benefits EFS gives us out of the box. During this quarter, we:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Set up automated backups so we can recover files in cases of disaster&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up automated alerting (via prometheus and pagerduty) to know if our backing EBS device is getting full and we need to perform a manual intervention&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployed this to a few other communities (

&lt;p>We had worked in the past with many communities in enabling
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/qgis-greenland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGIS on the Cloud&lt;/a>, and this quarter we got closer to enabling a contextual &amp;lsquo;Open in QGIS&amp;rsquo; button in the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >VEDA Dashboard&lt;/a>! Here is a quick demo:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./open-in-qgis.mp4" muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(This shows the workflow when user is already logged into the JupyterHub and had started the server)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can play with this in
&lt;a href="https://deploy-preview-688--ghg-demo.netlify.app/exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this preview&lt;/a>, although you need to have access to the NASA VEDA hub to fully try it out at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tarashish from Development Seed is again responsible for most of the work here, available in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunu/jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy&lt;/a>. You can use it to create &amp;lsquo;magic links&amp;rsquo; that will open QGIS in a desktop environment in your browser, and add a specific layer to it! Our hope is that this allows primarily GIS folks to better use tools they already are familiar with in cloud based contexts.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Project Pythia is an open access educational initiative established with funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Its mission is to help students and scientists enhance their skills and adopt best practices using the tools and technologies of open science. As part of the Pangeo community, Project Pythia primarily focuses on the Pangeo stack, which includes cloud computing, Jupyter technologies, GitHub, and various software packages in the Scientific Python ecosystem, centered around Xarray. Project Pythia offers a wide range of open access content, such as datasets, software, tutorials, and annotated real-world workflows presented in the form of Jupyter Books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project Pythia serves as a resource for scientists, promoting and fostering open science. Although it is not a scientific research artifact itself, the development of Project Pythia adheres to many best practices advocated by open science proponents. The Pythia team actively encourages community engagement and collaborates openly with scientists and technologists to create new content. All Pythia resources are freely accessible, and the project follows the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) for managing research outputs, including publications, data, and other materials. We support and facilitate open evaluation and peer reviews of content to ensure verifiability and trust. Lastly, we endeavor to openly discuss ideas, designs, and methods before implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation will provide an overview of Project Pythia&amp;rsquo;s extensive educational resources and share our experiences in applying many open science principles to develop this flagship training resource for the geoscience community.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-1">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, while bringing NASA&amp;rsquo;s Earth System Observatory &lt;em>up to speed&lt;/em> with aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial science capabilities, is also providing data records of the Earth System for the next generation of scientists &lt;em>to grow into&lt;/em>. The goal of the PACE Hackweek, supported by the Ocean Carbon &amp;amp; Biogeochemistry program and hosted at the University of Maryland Baltimore County in August 2024, was to enrich and support the practice of open science by both emerging and established researchers. Cloud-compute resources for the event were provided by CryoCloud, a NASA funded collaboration between ICESat-2 and the International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c) to provide cryosphere researchers with a shared JupyterHub. We, the hackweek mentors, were buoyed by the NASA Openscapes program and adopted its mantra of striving toward &amp;ldquo;a kinder science for future us.&amp;rdquo; Participants faced two novelties: the &amp;ldquo;firehose&amp;rdquo; of data from the PACE instrument array (a hyper-spectral imaging spectrometer, a wide-swath hyper-angular polarimeter, and a narrow-swath spectro-polarimeter), and the distribution of PACE collections through the NASA Earthdata Cloud (a first for the Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center). We present our approach and the challenges undertaken to hold an in-person, social coding event with 45 participants that provided a collaborative, supportive launchpad for doing open science with PACE. All lectures and tutorials produced for the event are freely available for examination and reuse. Our results additionally include highlights from the demonstration projects pursued by event participants and results from two post-event, qualitative surveys. One anonymous survey gathered participant feedback that will inform plans for growing these 45 participants into a lasting, open community. A separate, anonymous survey recorded participant demographics in order to evaluate our efforts at increasing diversity within the community of PACE data users. Key points of discussion include participant views, informed by our event, on whether and how the NASA Earthdata Cloud is a significant resource for the practice of open science with PACE, and how a shared JupyterHub can further the practice of open science by the community it serves.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>If we&amp;rsquo;re asking people to change for open science, we must be willing to change ourselves. Internalizing this as individuals and institutions is critical - &amp;ldquo;to address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver&amp;rdquo; (Johnson &amp;amp; Wilkinson, All We Can Save).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radically reshaping our society and including more solvers requires Earth scientists of all disciplines, across AGU, to work together in new ways. Many of these shifts can be considered Open science. They change how we work daily, not just the open products we produce. And for that, people need to consider themselves part of a team, let go of perfection and embrace a growth mindset to continually reflect and improve skills – no matter their job title. Further, open science requires all of us to see ourselves as leaders making small changes that collectively add up to a movement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Openscapes is an open source approach to cultivating leaders and change makers. Openscapes&amp;rsquo; flywheel approach intervenes and builds momentum through identifying mentors within organizations and mentoring teams curious about shifting to open science (Robinson &amp;amp; Lowndes 2022). Collectively, the Openscapes flywheel iterations have had a significant impact over the past five years across institutions like the federal government and academia that seem impossible to change. Through stories working with professional scientists over the past 5 years including at NASA, NOAA, Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science, and many universities, and open source software communities like 2i2c, Posit, Pangeo, and RLadies, we will share actionable insights for flourishing in the open science commons, and are interested in learning with and growing flywheel momentum further at AGU.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-3">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The Earth Observation (EO) industry has seen rapid technological advancements alongside a massive increase in the number of private and public missions, leading to exponentially growing data archives. For publicly funded entities, this data is typically required to be freely available. However, open data does not always guarantee accessibility, and significant barriers remain for even the most advanced users. The stagnation in the use and adoption of open data can be attributed to several factors, including 1) challenges in unifying and maintaining metadata standards, 2) inefficiencies associated with legacy data formats, 3) a lack of training and resources for transitioning to cloud-based infrastructure, and 4) systemic social inequalities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk will explore real-life examples of these barriers and highlight success stories that have emerged from partnerships largely originating within open-source communities which foster diverse connections between private and public entities including efforts like GeoZarr, pangeo-forge, Openscapes and 2i2c. While many advancements in improving the usability and accessibility of EO data have come from private efforts (i.e. Google Earth Engine), the shutdown of the Planetary Computer is a reminder of the need for publicly funded alternatives. The sustainability of open source projects will be addressed, with questions posed around reliable funding mechanisms as a means to ensure equitable development to address barriers and ensure accessibility for all. While this talk will be presented by one individual, it is the review and reflection of the work done by dozens of people across various organizations.&lt;/p>

Abstract

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The EarthScope Consortium manages NSF&amp;rsquo;s GAGE and SAGE facilities and makes all of its geophysical data available in a commercial cloud system. This enables EarthScope and the communities it supports to leverage the abundant computational resources and cost-effective benefits of adopting data-proximate workflows with direct access to large, analysis-ready geophysical data sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In recent years, JupyterHub environments have gained popularity with data enthusiasts for their ability to provide open access to powerful compute resources. As part of a broad effort to support communities with intuitive resources to quickly adapt their workflows to the cloud, EarthScope has partnered with 2i2c to operate a scalable JupyterHub environment in AWS that will provide equitable access to cloud compute resources for researchers, educators, and the general public. GeoLab, the EarthScope hub, is aligned with related open science initiatives to establish rigorous and transparent standards for reproducible, data-intensive workflows. In addition to promoting interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborative work between researchers in GeoLab, EarthScope is developing and hosting workshops that can support both in-person and asynchronous learning modules that will train users how to utilize these new resources and transition their work to the cloud. We are excited to invite all geophysical data users to participate in the vigorous growth of this new platform and collaborate with adjacent open-science compute hub initiatives.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-5">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Project Pythia is the flagship education and training initiative of the Pangeo community. Pangeo has advanced transformative platforms and paradigms for &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; geoscience in the cloud; Pythia is creating on-ramps for new users with open, interactive learning resources centered on Python in the geosciences. Pythia is now building a vibrant community-owned clearinghouse of accessible, reusable, and reproducible tutorials and exemplar workflows in the cloud known as Pythia Cookbooks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Cookbooks&amp;rdquo; imply collections of recipes for transforming raw ingredients (publicly available data) into scientifically useful results. Based on Jupyter notebooks, Cookbooks are explicitly tied to reproducible computational environments and supported by a rich cloud-based infrastructure enabling collaborative authoring and automated health-checking – essential tools in the struggle against the widespread notebook obsolescence problem. Cookbooks are hosted on Pythia&amp;rsquo;s searchable gallery and nurtured by a growing community of open science enthusiasts from across the geosciences. The Pythia Cookbook gallery is essentially a crowd-sourced, community-curated collection of best practices for data analysis and visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we will outline the stack of technologies and infrastructure enabling cookbook creation, collaboration, testing, publication, and interactive deployment, and how these are used in service of building an inclusive participatory community. We will discuss existing technical and social hurdles for contributors, as well as new infrastructure developments in collaboration with the Executable Books Project that are reducing these hurdles.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-6">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In this talk we will highlight our NASA Openscapes community teaching approach to using the 2i2c-managed JupyterHub – how we&amp;rsquo;ve collaboratively developed it to meet user needs, and how it continues to enable researchers and users of NASA Earthdata in the new Cloud paradigm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NASA Openscapes is an open source mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers (
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >DAACs&lt;/a>) that helps users explore and use the Cloud for their science and applications.
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Earthdata Cloud Cookbook&lt;/a> is a learner-focused open source tutorial collection that we update openly as we learn together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A critical piece of the NASA Openscapes effort is our &lt;strong>NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub&lt;/strong>, a managed cloud computing space. By working with cloud early adopters and science
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2024-07-24-2024-nasa-champions-cohort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Champions&lt;/a>, responding and co-developing solutions, the JupyterHub has evolved since its early days in 2021. We support cloud computing for several languages (python, R, Matlab, QGIS) and common science libraries with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/corn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >corn&lt;/a>; we streamlined how to bulk-add workshop participants via GitHub Teams; we established policy and technology for a special authentication mechanism for large scale workshops; we are developing earthaccess as an community-developed python library for NASA Earthdata search and access, whether locally or in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the last 3 years of engaging with the user community and the Hub, we have &lt;strong>evolved&lt;/strong> how we &lt;strong>onboard&lt;/strong> (first experience in the cloud) and &lt;strong>fledge&lt;/strong> (set up for Cloud that includes a plan, how to do it, how to pay for it; leaving the nest and perhaps building your own). Fledging is an important part of adoption and initiating users to the Cloud - where do researchers go when they decide to do their science in the Cloud? We&amp;rsquo;ve been developing practices that aim to be equitable and consider policy (cost), technical (where do people go, what admin setup is needed, what tech like base images etc are needed), and social (how do I learn, get support) aspects, and look forward to discussing further at AGU.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-7">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Numerical models are essential for forecasting volcanic hazards for both short-term responses and long-term hazard assessment. While many models of volcanic processes already exist, challenges in finding, installing, and evaluating these models, coupled with limited computational resources, hinder their widespread use. To address this, we introduce VICTOR, the Volcanology Infrastructure for Computational Tools and Resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR is a cutting-edge cyber-infrastructure platform offering an open-source, cloud-based environment tailored for the volcanology community. It features Jupyter notebooks that integrate existing volcano models, such as the lava flow codes MOLASSES and IMEX_lava, the tephra and ash dispersal codes Tephra2 and HYSPLIT, and the mass flow code TITAN2D. The backend of VICTOR is managed as a JupyterHub, operated by the non-profit 2i2c under the Code for Science and Society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR not only provides access to individual modeling tools, but also hosts workflows that use them in data inversion, model benchmarking, and uncertainty quantification. For example, we developed a workflow to validate mass flow models using multiple metrics and Bayesian statistics. VICTOR provides built-in access to external databases such as OpenTopography, Copernicus, and NASA&amp;rsquo;s remote sensing products to streamline obtaining and using data in workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR also serves as an educational resource. In Spring 2023 and 2024 we taught graduate level, multi-institutional courses in Computational Volcanology using VICTOR, and we are creating multilingual tutorials for the workflows. We are developing teaching modules on topics such as lava flows and remote sensing to be shared with instructors. Lastly, VICTOR collaborates with national efforts including CONVERSE and SZ4D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, VICTOR addresses the critical need for accessible, effective volcanic hazard modeling tools and resources, fostering advancements in both research and education within the volcanology community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plain-language-summary">
Plain-language Summary
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#plain-language-summary">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>VICTOR is a new online platform designed to help scientists predict volcanic hazards more easily. Traditional models can be difficult to find, use, and combine with other tools. VICTOR solves these problems by offering a cloud-based, open-source environment with user-friendly tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR includes tools like Jupyter notebooks that combine various volcano models for lava flows, ash dispersal, and mass movements. It operates through JupyterHub, managed by the non-profit 2i2c. The platform not only provides access to these models but also offers workflows for tasks like data analysis and model validation. For example, it has a workflow for testing mass flow models using multiple evaluation methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR simplifies data access by connecting directly to databases like OpenTopography and NASA&amp;rsquo;s remote sensing products. It&amp;rsquo;s also an educational tool, used in graduate courses and offering multilingual tutorials. Additionally, VICTOR is developing teaching materials on topics like lava flows and remote sensing and collaborates with national projects like CONVERSE and SZ4D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In essence, VICTOR makes volcanic hazard modeling more accessible and effective, benefiting both research and education in volcanology.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul></description></item><item><title>2024 impact report: new team structure, new funding, and growth in our network</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/retrospective/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/retrospective/</guid><description>&lt;p>2024 has been a busy year for 2i2c, with many highs and lows, a lot of impact, and significant organizational change. As the year comes to an end, I want to reflect on the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done in 2024, and where we aim to go in 2025.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2024, 2i2c reached the point in an organization&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle when a team has grown enough in size and complexity that you must change the ways that you organize. The informal ways that worked as a small group don&amp;rsquo;t suffice anymore, and you have to put more effort into aligning and coordinating everyone to ensure you have the same impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I call this the &amp;ldquo;$1M to $2M budget jump&amp;rdquo;, because organizations seem to hit this point around when your annual budget goes from &lt;code>$1M&lt;/code> to &lt;code>$2M&lt;/code>. Getting to the other side of this gap with an intact runway and team is hard, and I suspect that 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s fully distributed nature means that we hit these scaling milestones earlier than many organizations. For us, this has been a major focus of effort all year, and has involved taking a top-to-bottom look at our plans and ways of working as a team. Read on for more details about major updates, challenges, and impact that our team had in 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="organizational-updates">
Organizational updates
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-updates">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At an organizational level, this year had a lot of introspection and planning, a few new roles, a few departing team members, a funding crunch, a successful effort to dig out of it, and a new system of work organizing our team. We&amp;rsquo;ll share more about all of this later, but here are the major implications for our team:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;ve raised another $2.2M in funding&lt;/strong> to support our efforts in scaling and sustaining our network of community hubs. This gives us roughly another 2 years of projected runway (with some assumptions about revenue from contracts and grants). Below are two posts that describe two major awards we were awarded in Q3 and Q4 of this year:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-czi/" >A one-year award from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-navigation/" >A two-year award from The Navigation Fund&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;ve designed and hired several strategic and systems-level roles&lt;/strong> to give our team support and direction as it grows. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief summary:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/giuliano-maciocci/" >Head of Product, Giuliano Maciocci&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Giuliano leads our efforts to define and steward our value proposition and the roadmap of development for products and services that feeds into it. Giuliano has 10+ years experience driving growth in companies, was the ex-Chief Product Officer at Ex Ordo, ex-head of Product at eLife Sciences where he led the open science product
&lt;a href="https://elifesciences.org/collections/d72819a9/executable-research-articles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Executable Research Article&lt;/a>, and contributed significantly to mobile design and innovation at Adobe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/harold-campbell/" >Chief of Staff and Delivery Manager, Harold Campbell&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Harold leads our delivery and operations efforts, and stewards our system of work and coordination around it to ensure we deliver on our commitments efficiently and reliably. Harold has 15+ years of industry experience spanning companies in Africa and Jamaica, and 10+ years experience in agile consulting and coaching in technical and product teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/april-johnson/" >People Lead, April Johnson&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. April leads and stewards our system to support our team as individuals, ensuring that we provide the guidance and support needed to grow our team members in their careers and skills. April has 20+ years growing and guiding technology organizations. She is the ex-Global Head of Transformation at Thoughtworks (Europe, Latin America, India, North America, and Asia), with expertise in human-centered design, agility, people leadership, change, leading remote and asynchronous agile teams, coaching, and non-profit development.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;ve re-organized our team into separate product and business development teams&lt;/strong>, in order to focus on &lt;em>providing an excellent technical platform and a collection of services that maximizes community impact&lt;/em>, as well as &lt;em>sustaining this service for our communities&lt;/em>. This has allowed us to more effectively coordinate our service enhancement and development efforts, and increases our ability to deliver improvements to our communities and to upstream projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, our organization has a much stronger foundation to build upon as we continue to grow and refine our sustainability model in 2025. It has positioned us to more effectively deal with the challenges in reaching our next milestones for scale and impact, and gives us the tools to be more adaptive and responsive to community needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along the way, we also generated a lot of impact through our collaborations with communities in our network, and in the upstream projects that we support. For more details about our impact, see the summaries below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-impact">
Community impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#community-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core mission is to support its network of communities that create and share knowledge with open infrastructure. Here are the highlights of how our community network has grown and had impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we&amp;rsquo;ve grown our network of hubs and users through several new partnerships. We &lt;strong>grew the number of active hubs from ~75 to ~105&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>grew our end-of-year Monthly Active Users (MAUs) from ~6000 to ~8000&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

Open source technology enhancements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-technology-enhancements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Our second pillar of impact is to improve the ecosystem of open infrastructure and the open science workflows it enables. We use collaborations with our community partners to drive new cycles of development in open source tools that we support. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of our impact across the open source ecosystem this year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2024, 2i2c team members

&lt;p>Here are a few highlights where we focused our effort this year - each of these efforts required both development with and for our community network, as well as upstream contributions and support:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We released
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles-rollout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>JupyterHub Fancy Profiles&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, which allows for a more flexible and modern interface to launch environments with JupyterHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We used this to allow users to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/nasa-ephemeral-hubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>build and launch custom environments in JupyterHub&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> in a way that users can also share with others.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve added a Grafana dashboard for
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/aws-cost-attribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>resource and cost monitoring with JupyterHub&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> to give communities more visibility over their projected cloud costs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We began
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/project-pythia-cookoff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>incorporating Jupyter Book 2.0 workflows into our community hubs&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> and laid a foundation for enabling our communuty networks to communicate with one another more effectively using the new MyST document engine. Read more in our

Looking to next year
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#looking-to-next-year">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2025 is going to be a critical year for 2i2c to build upon the work we began in 2024 to achieve a more sustainable and scalable community model. Here are the main areas that will guide our work in the new year and into 2026, pulled from our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-navigation/" >recent proposal from The Navigation Fund&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #1: Delivery&lt;/strong>. Develop the operating structure and team skills to
efficiently scale our product and service delivery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #2: Product&lt;/strong>. Develop a product system that continuously improves and
delivers value and impact at scale.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #3: Sustainability&lt;/strong>. Build a business model that is competitive and gives
us resources to sustain and scale our service.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These are the key goals 2i2c must achieve in order to ensure that its service remains impactful, sustainable, scalable, and accessible. We believe that we&amp;rsquo;ve laid a strong foundation to get there, and are excited to begin work next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, 2024 has been a challenging, but also a rewarding year for our team. We&amp;rsquo;ve encountered and successfully worked thorugh a number of scaling challenges, and we&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress at laying a foundation on which we can build for the years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly proud of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team for all of their hard work this year, and also honored to be working with a network of communities that care about open infrastructure and its value for creating and sharing knowledge with the world. Here&amp;rsquo;s to another year of impact!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Financial support from The Navigation Fund for identifying and building a scalable sustainability model</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-navigation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-navigation/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are proud to announce that 2i2c has received financial support from

&lt;p>The award totals &lt;strong>~$1.5M over 2 years&lt;/strong>. It provides support for several key strategic roles that are traditionally difficult to fund in a young organization: product management, delivery management, and business development. Here are the key goals this funding works toward:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #1: Delivery&lt;/strong>. Develop the operating structure and team skills to
efficiently scale our product and service delivery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #2: Product&lt;/strong>. Develop a product system that continuously improves and

&lt;p>It is designed to be lightweight and flexible, and can be run on a variety of shared infrastructure. For those who wish to run this project on cloud infrastructure, we&amp;rsquo;ve also published a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/frx-challenges-helm-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Helm Chart to help you deploy &lt;code>frx-challenges&lt;/code> with Kubernetes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it can be run on its own, we believe that it naturally complements other tools and services for interactive computing and data, such as &lt;strong>JupyterHub&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Jupyter Book&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Binder&lt;/strong>. More on that below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a brief description of the motivation behind this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-frictionless-research-exchanges">
What are Frictionless Research Exchanges
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-frictionless-research-exchanges">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The project is heavily inspired by David Donoho&amp;rsquo;s vision of &lt;strong>Frictionless Research Exchanges&lt;/strong> (FRX) as described in
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00865" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;em>Data Science at the Singularity&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, Donoho describes three key pillars for Frictionless Research Exchanges:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The three initiatives are related but separate; and all three have to come together, and in a particularly strong way, to provide the conditions for the new era. Here they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>[FR-1: Data] datafication of everything, with a culture of research data sharing. One can now find datasets publicly available online on a bewildering variety of topics, from chest x-rays to cosmic microwave background measurements to uber routes to geospatial crop identifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[FR-2: Re-execution] research code sharing including the ability to exactly re-execute the same complete workflow by different researchers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[FR-3: Challenges] adopting challenge problems as a new paradigm powering scientific research. The paradigm includes: a shared public dataset, a prescribed and quantified task performance metric, a set of enrolled competitors seeking to outperform each other on the task, and a public leaderboard. Thousands of such challenges with millions of entries have now taken place, across many fields.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We considered the landscape of tools and services, and felt that [FR-1] and [FR-2] were already well-served by a variety of tools and services for community workspace infrastructure (e.g., JupyterHub:
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub.readthedocs.io&lt;/a>), sharable computational environments (e.g., BinderHub:
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >binderhub.readthedocs.io&lt;/a>), authoring and reading computational narratives (e.g., Jupyter Book:
&lt;a href="https://jupyterbook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterbook.org&lt;/a> and MyST:
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mystmd.org&lt;/a>), and data I/O tools and standards (e.g., Zarr:
&lt;a href="https://zarr.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >zarr.readthedocs.io&lt;/a> and Intake:
&lt;a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >intake.readthedocs.io&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However there was a natural missing piece for &lt;strong>[FR-3 Challenges]&lt;/strong>, and we could not identify any community-managed infrastructure that facilitated data challenges. This is the goal of &lt;code>frx-challenges&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-facilitate-data-challenges">
Why facilitate data challenges?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-facilitate-data-challenges">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Data challenges are harder than you think! While it is simple enough to run somebody else&amp;rsquo;s code locally, data challenges require a systematic, secure, and automated approach to accepting and evaluating submissions in a fair and repeatable way. Here are some of the big challenges to tackle:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Submissions must retain user and team identity&lt;/strong>, which means that we must keep track of users and their submissions over time, since data challenges are designed to encourage iterative improvement and optimization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluations must use potentially complex resources and data&lt;/strong> since many data challenges operate by publicly sharing a small dataset, and then running it against a much more complex dataset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluations must be totally secure&lt;/strong>, so that submissions can&amp;rsquo;t do nefarious things like mine cryptocurrency or extract the challenge&amp;rsquo;s private data in unintended ways.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluations must be automated&lt;/strong>, so that running the challenge does not require extensive human intervention and can scale to many users.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluation must be flexible&lt;/strong>, so that the infrastructure can accept a variety of types of submissions (e.g. code, data, model weights, etc), run them with arbitrary environments designed by the organizers, and run them with the right hardware to get the job done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These are just a few of the major challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to address with &lt;code>frx-challenges&lt;/code>, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to see how it goes with our first assisted community challenge: the
&lt;a href="https://cellmapchallenge.janelia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Cellmap Challenge&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is still the &lt;strong>very early stages&lt;/strong> of the project, and we imagine it will evolve significantly. We welcome feedback for how it can more effectively serve a variety of communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
(Profile List for the NASA VEDA JupyterHub with &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, we rolled this new experience out to all 2i2c managed JupyterHubs! Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick rundown of what this enables:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Descriptions for choices in the dropdowns, making it much easier for users to know what they are getting with each environment (or resource selection).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fully backwards compatible with the existing KubeSpawner profile list implementation. In our PR to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/5083" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >roll this out&lt;/a> to all hubs, you notice that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to change the structure of any profile lists! So you can safely roll this out to your hubs too without needing to fundamentally change how your profiles are set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is a modern web app (built with
&lt;a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >react&lt;/a>), just like the JupyterHub admin panel. This allows us to evolve and satisfy user needs much faster, as well as expanding the pool of people who can contribute to the project!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support for dynamically building images using
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> style repositories! It talks to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >binderhub&lt;/a> API so users can build reproducible environments as they wish without admin involvement nor needing to fully understand how docker and containers work. Our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >earlier blog post&lt;/a> has more information.&lt;/p>

&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is just the start, and thanks to ongoing funding from the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA&lt;/a> project, we are going to continue making improvements to this experience.&lt;/p>

This contrasts with Jupyter Book 1, which was built on top of the Sphinx documentation engine, but offered its own CLI and configuration files. In future, the &lt;code>jupyter book&lt;/code> and &lt;code>mystmd&lt;/code> CLIs may diverge from one another, but we expect that this will be handled in a graceful manner: &lt;code>mystmd&lt;/code> commands should always be compatible with the &lt;code>jupyter book&lt;/code> application.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Catalyst Project is a community-engaged initiative designed to support the adoption of open science principles in under-served bioscientific research communities through the provision of reliable and sustainable cloud computing infrastructure. It’s a project we’ve been working on now for almost two years, which involves staff from seven different organizations:
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://carpentries.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >The Carpentries&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://ccad.unc.edu.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CCAD&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://www.cscce.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CSCCE&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://investinopen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >IOI&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://metadocencia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MetaDocencia&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="http://openlifesci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OLS&lt;/a>, and is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key part of the project is engaging with Community Partners in Africa and Latin America: Institutions, organizations, and individuals who are undertaking bioscientific research projects that require cloud computing infrastructure. As collaborators on the Catalyst Project, Community Partners can access and use 2i2c’s open science cloud services, and also receive training from 2i2c, The Carpentries, MetaDocencia, and OLS to support their work.
&lt;a href="https://catalystproject.cloud/current-community-partners.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Community Partners&lt;/a> also play a vital role in shaping an evolving governance model for the Catalyst Project to help sustain, scale, and maximize impact in Latin America, Africa, and under-served communities around the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a new collection of blog posts (that we hope will expand over the next couple of months!) we’re highlighting the work of the Catalyst Project Community Partners. This post is a gateway to learning more about the Catalyst Project and its Community Partners. If you have any questions or feedback about the project, please

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Creating a series of blog posts to highlight the work of the Catalyst Community Partners was a collaborative effort involving staff from CSCCE, 2i2c, OLS, and MetaDocencia. Specifically, Lou Woodley, Katie Pratt, Jenny Wong, and Tajuddeen Gwadabe conceived the idea during our regular Catalyst Project “website team” meetings, and developed a strategy for reaching out to community partners to gather information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Katie then led that outreach, which involved a representative of each Community Partners completing a Google Form to answer three key questions and sharing a photo (or a selection of photos) to use on the blog. Katie curated all of the information, edited together the blog posts, and secured sign-off from all of the partners. Sabrina López and her team at MetaDocencia coordinated the translation of the posts from English to Spanish, and Jenny formatted and published them on the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re grateful to the Community Partners for generously sharing more about their work – and we look forward to highlighting more Catalyst Project Community Partners soon!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Support from CZI to sustain 2i2c's mission to help communities create and share knowledge with open infrastructure</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-czi/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-czi/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are proud to announce that 2i2c has received financial support from

&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >DeepLabCut team&lt;/a> is a group of researchers and developers who are working on open source tools for analyzing animal pose estimation by training deep neural networks on videos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chris Holdgraf visited the lab in early August to learn more about how the group were using open-source tools to document and share their work.&lt;/p>

Jupyter Book and MyST
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyter-book-and-myst">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Extensive documentation for using the DeepLabCut software package is already available as a
&lt;a href="https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book&lt;/a>. The group was interested in adopting MyST Markdown to stay ahead of the curve and upgrade their Jupyter Book (see the related announcement

&lt;p>Chris led a mini-hackathon to introduce the group to MyST and collect feedback on where enhancement features could be made in the future. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the outcomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many improvements were made to the
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST documentation&lt;/a> 📖
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST Quick Start Guide&lt;/a> was used to onboard new users. Amendments were
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/1433" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >upstreamed to the MyST docs directly&lt;/a> and were immediately available to all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-executable-documents" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tutorial on executable documents&lt;/a> was added to the collection of MyST tutorials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MyST-MD installation instructions were
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/1454" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >simplified using &lt;code>mamba&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A bunch of enhancement features were requested ✨
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1455" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Using cell tags for labelling notebook cells&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/321" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Support for loading user-defined CSS stylesheets for theming&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;/ul>

What is NeuroHackademy?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-neurohackademy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Part summer school, part free-wheeling hackathon, all focused on the use of data science methods in neuroscience, NeuroHackademy is an event that was recently hosted by the
&lt;a href="http://escience.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >University of Washington eScience Institute&lt;/a> in Seattle, WA, USA. This event, that has been running annually since 2016, aims to provide early-career researchers in Psychology, Medicine, Neuroscience, and other related fields with the skills and knowledge that they need to effectively and rigorously work with open source tools and workflows for analyzing human neuroscience data. This supports the effort to make scientific analysis and results shareable, reproducible, and accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="global-and-inclusive">
Global and inclusive
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#global-and-inclusive">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In 2020, the event had to rapidly pivot to an online format, and this format was also used in 2021. Through this experience, the organizers (
&lt;a href="https://arokem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Ariel Rokem&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://nben.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Noah Benson&lt;/a>) realized that many participants preferred the online format. For example, participants who could not afford to travel to Seattle, or participants who had care-taking responsibilities that precluded them from participating in a two-week event away from their homes. In 2022, the event pioneered a hybrid format, where half of the participants are present in-person and half join the event via zoom, slack, GitHub, and of course through a dedicated 2i2c JupyterHub. Taken together, this format allows the participation of students from a larger range of backgrounds and locations. This aspect plays an important part in building a global and inclusive community of practice. See the paper
&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38763989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hands-On Neuroinformatics Education at the Crossroads of Online and In-Person: Lessons Learned from NeuroHackademy&lt;/a> to read more on this subject.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>NeuroHackademy has been an early adopter of the cloud-based JupyterHub model, setting up its first hub using the zero-to-jupyterhub guide in 2018. NeuroHackademy partnered with 2i2c as soon as it was founded, and 2i2c has operated a JupyterHub for the last 3 years. The hub provides an interactive computing platform for learners, and implements the &amp;ldquo;digital watering hole&amp;rdquo; for practical and immediate access to a range of cloud-based datasets in human neuroscience (see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/neurohackademy-summer-school/" >blog post&lt;/a> announcing support for this year&amp;rsquo;s event).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of the software environment, the following tools and features that have benefited the event over the years include&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>nbgitpuller&lt;/code>&lt;/a> allows students to synchronise lesson content with an organizational GitHub repository that is collaboratively maintained by the lesson instructors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Shared data file storage&lt;/a> with read-only access for learners and read-write access for instructors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Access to an abundance of neuroimaging data hosted in cloud object storage

&lt;li>And more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="this-year">
This year
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#this-year">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This year 2i2c supported the following tools and features for NeuroHackademy&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &amp;ldquo;Bring your own image&amp;rdquo; option where users can pull any image hosted on a container registry into the hub. See our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" >Integrating BinderHub with JupyterHub: Empowering users to manage their own environments&lt;/a> blog post for more details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>repo2docker&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and GitHub actions to build and prototype images from a repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The support services provided by 2i2c and the ability for instructors to
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/contributing/community-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >open pull requests on 2i2c infrastructure&lt;/a> for speedy resolution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GPU instances to support more compute intensive workloads for machine learning.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="next-year">
Next year
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#next-year">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One thing we have learned is that 2i2c automatically
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/control-user-server/#stop-user-servers-after-inactivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >shuts down a user server after one hour of inactivity&lt;/a> by default to ensure efficient resource usage and limit runaway cloud costs. Naturally, we are seeing increasing demand from learners for longer and more complex analyses. In response to this, we are keen to explore how the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/minrk/jupyter-keepalive" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyter-keepalive&lt;/code>&lt;/a> extension can keep the server alive for long-running processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are pleased that learners have made great progress in making use of cloud-native, open-source workflows for analyzing human neuroscience data. We are keen to benefit from lessons learned this year and are looking forward to collaborating with 2i2c once again to deliver the NeuroHackademy Summer School in 2025.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watch this space next year!&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://pace.gsfc.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PACE&lt;/a> is the NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem mission that focuses on understanding ocean health and its impact on the atmosphere. Together with the
&lt;a href="https://www.us-ocb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Ocean Carbon and Biochemistry (OCB)&lt;/a> program, a one-week
&lt;a href="https://pacehackweek.github.io/pace-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >hackathon&lt;/a> ran from Aug 4 to Aug 8 on the 2i2c-hosted
&lt;a href="https://cryointhecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a> hub. The goal of the hackathon was to explore new Earth science data streams provided by the
&lt;a href="https://pace.oceansciences.org/oci.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OCI&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://pace.oceansciences.org/spexone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >SPEXone&lt;/a> and

&lt;h2 id="machine-learning-with-gpus">
Machine Learning with GPUs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#machine-learning-with-gpus">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the most advanced tutorials delivered during the hackathon was the
&lt;a href="https://pacehackweek.github.io/pace-2024/presentations/hackweek/ml_cloud_mask.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Machine Learning Tutorial&lt;/a>. The tutorial focused on creating a machine learning pipeline to detect cloud cover from satellite imagery. This was done by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to assign each pixel a binary value to indicate whether the location was covered by cloud or not. To improve the spatial context beyond a single pixel value, as the likelihood of a pixel containing cloud cover increases if its neighbours also contain cloud cover, the CNN needs to be trained on the entire image at once rather than at a single pixel level. This massively increases the training time, but also allows the CNN to learn more complex relationships between pixels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GPUs have a far greater number of cores than CPUs that are well-suited for accelerating the massive parallel processing needed to train a neural network on the large amounts of image data in the above scenario.
&lt;a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PyTorch&lt;/a> is a popular Python library for training CNNs, available for both CPUs and GPUs, and is an ideal tool for performing this kind of work. In terms of the accelerator hardware available on the CryoCloud hub, 2i2c provisions an instance with an
&lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU&lt;/a> with 4 CPUS, 16GB of RAM and 2,560 CUDA cores.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managing-shared-memory-on-2i2c-hubs">
Managing shared memory on 2i2c hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managing-shared-memory-on-2i2c-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While developing the above tutorial, tutorial lead Sean Foley (NASA/GSFC/SED &amp;amp; Morgan State University &amp;amp; GESTAR II) noticed that training neural networks was way slower than it should be given the GPUs available to them. They investigated the issue, and with help from the 2i2c engineering team, it was determined that shared memory was the issue. PyTorch uses shared memory via &lt;code>/dev/shm&lt;/code> for faster parallel processing, and maximizing use of GPU. However in containerized environments, this is limited to a maximum of 64MB by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-note">
&lt;div>
&lt;p>You can check the amount of shared memory available on your hub in a terminal with the command&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>df -h | grep /dev/shm&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As you might expect, 64 MB of shared memory is not enough for training over 160,000 images in the tutorial. 2i2c was able to remove the limit, making &lt;code>/dev/shm&lt;/code> share the memory the user has selected via their profile list, rather than be artificially limited to any particular size. This was done for &lt;em>all&lt;/em> users on the CryoCloud hub within an hour of the issue being reported and we upstreamed the change for &lt;em>all&lt;/em> 2i2c hubs (see GitHub pull requests for
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/4564" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/4563" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >all 2i2c hubs&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This event demonstrates the economy of how running shared and open infrastructure dynamically solves problems for the benefit of many users, not just for one occasion. Learning experiences such as the above are transferred and embedded upstream into transparent and flexible open source software that impacts not only all users of 2i2c operated hubs, but also generalized for the wider research community at large (case in point, see the Slack thread below from
&lt;a href="https://eeholmes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Eli Holmes&lt;/a>, operator of the
&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-data/open-science-noaa-fisheries" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NOAA Fisheries&lt;/a> hubs)! We are grateful for the strong partnerships with our communities who help us to co-design impactful solutions that are specific for their needs and accessible to all.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a>, following our previous work on launching the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/" >US GHG center&lt;/a> (also see the
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/blog/2023-12-14-ghg-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed blog post&lt;/a>). Together with scientists at NASA in our regular sync touchpoints, we have recently delivered a tranche of improvements to

the combined 2i2c and Development Seed team had for the last quarter. In this blog post, we will describe some of the significant ones!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-image-management-and-testing">
Better image management and testing
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#better-image-management-and-testing">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker-action&lt;/a> is a GitHub action simplifying image building and testing for use with JupyterHub, using either a &lt;code>Dockerfile&lt;/code> or various
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration files&lt;/a> (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code>, &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>, etc) supported by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>. We migrated our image building pipeline from a somewhat homegrown solution to this upstream action, making image updates and testing &lt;em>much&lt;/em> easier. In particular, we can
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pangeo-notebook-veda-image/pull/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >automatically run test notebooks&lt;/a> on every change we make to the image! This way, we can easily catch any breaking changes in library versions or other package installs without disrupting users. We also debugged and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action/pull/124" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >contributed upstream&lt;/a> fixes to the testing infrastructure so everyone could benefit from this, rather than just us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">
Automatically pulling example notebooks on startup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When a user logs into a JupyterHub, it is very helpful if we could have a bunch of example notebooks and other content pre-populated for them so they can get started right away.
&lt;a href="https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> is heavily used for this particular use case. However, it requires that nbgitpuller is installed inside the image the user is using - and not all images have it installed. In particular, we wanted to continue using the (wonderful)
&lt;a href="https://rocker-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Rocker images&lt;/a> maintained upstream for R users, however they do not have nbgitpuller installed. To solve this problem we built
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/jupyterhub-gitpuller-init" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-gitpuller-init&lt;/a>, which can be used as an
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >init container&lt;/a> to pre-populate user content on persistent home directories regardless of the image used. We also made sure to build this in a way that &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> can use it, and it is not tied into either 2i2c or VEDA infrastructure!&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/nasa-qgis-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >container image&lt;/a> that allows users to access large datasets stored in the cloud directly through QGIS on the JupyterHub, allowing users to work with much larger datasets than they could on their desktops by bringing cloud compute adjacent to the data. As a continuation of this work, we developed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunu/jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy&lt;/a>, which builds QGIS specific features on top of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy&lt;/a>. In particular, it allows creation of shareable links that when clicked, opens specific datasets and layers in QGIS in a JupyterHub! You can see this in action:&lt;/p>

Work will continue in the coming quarter towards achieving this vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are also excited to see recent work in this space
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/jupytergis-d63b7adf9d0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >from QuantStack and Simula Labs&lt;/a>, and will follow up to ensure an orderly transition to more web native workflows for existing users of QGIS in due time.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Working closely with the 2i2c team on growing features to support users on the VEDA and GHG Center hubs has been absolutely amazing. With 2i2c’s deep experience in the Jupyter ecosystem, we have been able to implement some fairly complex features quite easily, and their strong open-source roots have ensured that whatever we work on is broadly useful to the wider Jupyter and scientific computing communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://openscapes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Openscapes&lt;/a> is a value-based initiative that supports kinder, better science based on open source community.
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA Openscapes&lt;/a> is in its fourth year as a project supporting NASA Earth science in the Cloud, co-developed by Julia Lowndes (Openscapes) and Erin Robinson (Metadata Game Changers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initiative recently supported the

&lt;p>This event was attended by around 250 participants. An event of this size therefore requires a &lt;em>frictionless login flow&lt;/em> so that organizers could focus on the essential complexity of teaching data analysis rather than the accidental complexity of managing Hub authorization. GitHub authentication is the default option for most 2i2c Hubs for research use cases, but for an educational event of this size this option was not fit for purpose since organizers had to&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Retrieve the GitHub usernames of each participant (assuming everyone was familiar with GitHub!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually invite GitHub users to a GitHub organization to authorize access to the Hub (invitations would expire within seven days)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repeat the above two steps last-minute for participants who showed up on the day without preparing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually remove GitHub users from the GitHub organization if they wanted to revoke access to the Hub after the event.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In response to this need, we developed a shared password feature so that workshop organizers can simply hand the share password out to learners for access to the Hub. This bypassed the manual labour of managing GitHub accounts while not adding to the learner&amp;rsquo;s high cognitive load and improving the participant&amp;rsquo;s learning experience overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the elements that enabled us to recognize and solve this issue effectively is our close partnership with the Openscapes team. We engage in regular
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2i2cAccessPolicies/issues/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >6-weekly catch-ups&lt;/a> where we can learn about user requirements and how we can develop our infrastructure to co-create optimal solutions. Together with our
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/product/deliveryflow/#defining-our-product-delivery-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Product Delivery Flow&lt;/a>, we were quickly able to architect the shared password solution in time for the workshop.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Spyglass&lt;/a> is a framework for reproducible and shareable neuroscience research produced by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/LorenFrankLab" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Loren Frank’s lab&lt;/a> at the University of California, San Francisco. Check out our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/hhmi-spyglass/" >blog post about the release of their preprint&lt;/a> to read more about the methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post focuses on the complex data storage needed for the project, which can be difficult to set up locally or at scale in the cloud. In particular, the analysis needed a MySQL database for reproducibility. This is a fairly common task across many fields. The aim of 2i2c is to enable researchers to focus on the essential complexity of what they were doing, i.e. the science, without managing the accidental complexity of how to do it &amp;ndash; in this case, setting up databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We describe how you can do this too for your own JupyterHubs. Since 2i2c commits to running our infrastructure in line with open-source values as much as possible, you can also directly see the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/99071c38712ef8e6bed6609117ca4b894b89ae5c/config/clusters/hhmi/spyglass.values.yaml#L76" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration for the hub&lt;/a> referenced in the paper.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Kubernetes definition of a
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >sidecar container&lt;/a> is&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sidecar containers are the secondary containers that run along with the main application container within the same Pod. These containers are used to enhance or to extend the functionality of the primary app container by providing additional services, or functionality such as logging, monitoring, security, or data synchronization, without directly altering the primary application code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In this case, the &lt;em>primary&lt;/em> app container is the JupyterLab instance where people are interactively running code and doing science. We want to provide a MySQL database as a sidecar so that each user server gets their own independent MySQL server instance (that is not accessible to anyone else). We can then run code such as&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">%%bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root --password=tutorial &amp;lt; path-to-sql-file-with-data
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>to load data into the database. Note the IP address &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code> - the MySQL server is listening on localhost, even though it is not running in the &lt;em>same container&lt;/em>! Thanks to the magic of
&lt;a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/580893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Linux Network Namespaces&lt;/a>, the sidecar and main app container can share &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code>. This allows you to write code that works &lt;strong>in the exact same way&lt;/strong> on a user&amp;rsquo;s local computers as on the JupyterHub, making transitions and replication easier.&lt;/p>

A diversity of team experiences helps us deliver a service that broadens and empowers participation in open-source science for all communities and leads to
&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >more effective teams that make better decisions&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a young and growing organization, we have had mixed success in building diversity within our team.
We&amp;rsquo;ve leaned into the values of our service that build trust and attract a broad coalition of community partners (and potential employees).
For example, we&amp;rsquo;ve used the following pillars in describing our service:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Transparency&lt;/strong> – our transparent and participatory model keeps our incentives aligned with community needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Empowerment&lt;/strong> – our service gives communities agency to design the service they need, and to manage it without 2i2c if they wish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Partnership&lt;/strong> – our communities are partners working towards shared impact, not customers to grow revenue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sustainability&lt;/strong> – our service should have a self-sustaining model that ensures continuity, growth, and funder independence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also invested in creating an inclusive organizational culture via documents like
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our Team Compass&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our Code of Conduct&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. We&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with inclusive hiring practices to encourage a diverse pool of applicants for our open positions, such as
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >running open office hours for job postings&lt;/a> in the hopes that this would encourage more people to apply who might otherwise have been hesitant (something that often correlates with people from historically marginalized communities).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-diverse-_leadership_">
The importance of diverse &lt;em>leadership&lt;/em>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-importance-of-diverse-_leadership_">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>However, over the past few months, we have reflected on our organization&amp;rsquo;s structure and future plans. In particular, we recognize that there is a worrying lack of women in staff leadership roles. This imbalance does not live up to our values of diversity in our team and service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to do better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is at a moment of maturation and growth as an organization, kicked off by
&lt;a href="" >our organizational audit from 2023&lt;/a> as well as
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/report-czi/" >our three-year retrospective&lt;/a>.
We believe that improving the diversity of leadership throughout the organization is a necessary part of that maturation over the next three years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few ideas for how we aim to make improvements, and we invite feedback from others who are interested in helping us improve this aspect of our organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-we-plan-to-do">
What we plan to do
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-plan-to-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the next few months, we will work on a long-term DEI strategy in tandem with our sustainability strategy as we work
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-community-networks/" >towards scalable and sustainable networks of community hubs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some steps we aim to take to improve the diversity of our leadership across the organization:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define our goals for diversity&lt;/strong>. First, we need a better understanding of the most important axes of diversity that we wish to design around. Gender is clearly a critical gap to cover, but there are many other important axes of diversity as well. For example, as an organization that serves a global community, it is important that we have global perspectives represented in our leadership.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define mechanisms for leadership and governance that includes representation along these axes&lt;/strong>. Leadership at a staff level is one way to ensure representation of diverse perspectives, but there are many other ways to bring voices into the conversation. We aim to explore new ways of bringing diverse voices into the strategic direction of the organization and provide mechanisms for holding us accountable to our values. For example, we intend to grow a &lt;em>board&lt;/em> to guide 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s strategy and hold its Executive Director accountable for achieving impact - this is another opportunity to bring diverse perspectives into our leadership.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make a plan for improving leadership diversity within our team&lt;/strong>. Whatever mechanisms we create for diverse leadership, we know that one of them needs to be improving our diversity at a staff leadership level. Our staff are the ones that spend the most time working on - and have the most leverage over - our strategy and mission, and it&amp;rsquo;s important that our staff leadership is a good representation of the diverse perspectives of the communities we serve. This might mean investing more heavily in reaching broad applicant pools for new positions, seeking external consultation for how we can avoid unintentionally sending exclusionary signals to others in our communications and outreach and developing incentives to retain our talent over time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Continue improving our systems of delivery and work&lt;/strong>. Finally, we believe that a crucial aspect of improving the diversity in our organization is to continue transforming our systems for delivery, reliability, and accountability across the organization. This effort is a crucial step for fostering an inclusive and equitable culture. We have
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/delivery-improvements/" >made a lot of progress in improving our delivery systems&lt;/a> and will continue this improvement as an organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We hope that this post both makes transparent a distinct lack of diversity within our organizational leadership and provides clarity for some of our plans to improve.
We are excited about the organization that we have built so far, as well as being fiercely proud of our open-source culture and development practises.
We still know that we must do better, and we&amp;rsquo;re fully committed to doing so over the coming years.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-did-we-do">
What did we do?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-did-we-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As part of the deliverables for our NASA High Priority Open-Source Science (HPOSS) award, we deployed two new ephemeral hubs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>a
&lt;a href="https://binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >public small BinderHub&lt;/a> that offers a &amp;ldquo;reader&amp;rdquo; experience where learners can interactively view GitHub repositories that deliver light scientific content with small compute and no barriers to authentication&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a
&lt;a href="https://hub.big.binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >big BinderHub&lt;/a> that offers an &amp;ldquo;explorer&amp;rdquo; experience where learners can log in to access more substantial compute resources to interactively investigate large datasets and run large workflows from any GitHub repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These services enrich the interactive computing ecosystem for NASA communities by&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>improving the shareability and reproducibility of scientific information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>broadening participation for historically excluded and under-resourced science communities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enabling activities such as hackathons, demonstrations or training, during workshops and conferences.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-did-we-do-it">
How did we do it?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-we-do-it">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ephemeral interactive computing services benefited from some of our previous development work in collaboration with GESIS (see our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" >detailed blog post&lt;/a> for more information). The research and development of this project achieved wide-reaching impact across many NASA communities we currently serve, including

&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >VEDA&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://cryointhecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a>; as well as networks beyond the NASA scope, such as the NSF-funded
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia&lt;/a> and HHMI-funded
&lt;a href="https://lorenfranklab.github.io/spyglass/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Spyglass&lt;/a> projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-next">
What next?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We will focus on bolstering the community- and knowledge-building needed for making the best use of these binder services in the next phase of our HPOSS work to accelerate broader participation in science. This includes opportunities such as running workshops and tutorials, as well as disseminating best practices for collaborative research. Further engineering developments will proceed in collaboration with the NASA VEDA project to set up a binder service, improve the sharing of custom environments, and refine QGIS integrations for analysing geospatial data.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (
&lt;a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CIRA&lt;/a>) is an interdisciplinary cooperation between NOAA research scientists and Colorado State University. CIRA is hosting a
&lt;a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/conferences/rmtgw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >summer school&lt;/a> for inverse modeling of greenhouse gases using atmospheric data assimilation techniques. The
&lt;a href="https://earth.gov/ghgcenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >US Greenhouse Gas Center&lt;/a> is supporting the workshop by providing 40+ attendees access to their interactive computing hub operated by 2i2c (see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/" >our blog post about their launch&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hub administrators have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/ssim-ghg-workshop-2024-python-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >built a customized software environment&lt;/a> with container technology for use at the workshop. In doing so, this bypasses the need for participants to individually install software on their own machines and the online hub provides a &lt;em>consistent&lt;/em> and &lt;em>reproducible&lt;/em> interactive computing environment that is easily &lt;em>accessible&lt;/em> and &lt;em>scalable&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a>, a community platform for Big Data geoscience in which 2i2c operates a cloud hub. The core aim of Project Pythia is to spearhead the creation and curation of community-driven, open-source documentation, in the form of &amp;ldquo;cookbooks&amp;rdquo;, to enable the adoption of &lt;em>open&lt;/em>, &lt;em>scalable&lt;/em> and &lt;em>reproducible&lt;/em> workflows for geoscientists.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Jenny, James and Angus from the 2i2c team participated in the annual
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/pythia-cookoff-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia Cook-off 2024&lt;/a>, a hackathon where cookbook authors and collaborators can spend dedicated time on creating and maintaining their content using
&lt;a href="https://jupyterbook.org/en/stable/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book&lt;/a> and deploying their cookbooks with GitHub actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c teamed up with the infrastructure breakout group during the hackathon, led by Katelyn FitzGerald (UCAR) and Kevin Tyle (University at Albany), and members of the
&lt;a href="https://curvenote.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Curvenote&lt;/a> team also joined the group.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c deployed and demonstrated a dedicated BinderHub service for Project Pythia that allowed hackathon participants to &amp;ldquo;self-serve&amp;rdquo; images of their software environment, which were specified by including a list of packages in an &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> file placed in their GitHub cookbook repository. Participants could then pull the image from a container registry into their 2i2c hub (or indeed, any other JupyterHub server) to share and reproduce their computational environments with ease.&lt;/p>

Day 2
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>During the first half of the day, we quickly identified a number of issues that were proving to be a maintenance headache for the Project Pythia infrastructure group:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Configuration files for each cookbook were difficult to update at scale. Project Pythia currently have a gallery of over 30 cookbooks!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Changes to Sphinx-based themes inherited from upstream were prone to breaking custom Project Pythia branding downstream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Executable content was not able to run on the Project Pythia&amp;rsquo;s dedicated BinderHub hosted on
&lt;a href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JetStream2&lt;/a> (operated by NSF).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Cookbooks frequently cross-referenced materials from other cookbooks to build upon pre-existing knowledge, but this was not easy to author and the reader experience was not as smooth as it could be.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Following the announcement that
&lt;a href="" >Jupyter Book 2.0 will use MyST&lt;/a> last month, Rowan (Curvenote) and Angus (2i2c) delivered a compelling demonstration of the
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST&lt;/a> ecosystem centered around modern web-first technologies (JavaScript/TypeScript) that offers improved interactivity and accessibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the second half of the day, we decided to use the hackathon to explore migrating the Pythia cookbooks from using a Sphinx-based to a MyST-based document structure and engine. Within one afternoon, the group migrated four cookbooks to use MyST MD&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This moment was palpably exciting! It was evident that MyST MD supported backwards compatible content out of the box, which alleviated fears of sunk cost into existing Sphinx-based cookbooks. The migration workflow was as simple as executing the following commands&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>conda install mystmd&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>myst&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="day-4">
Day 4
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Looking to the future, we spent time reflecting on our experiences and discussing the potential, transformative impact MyST MD tooling could have in the hands of the scientific community at large, including the communities served by 2i2c. Knowledge-sharing based on static figures and PDFs would fall obsolete and give way to a dynamic, web-first approach to sharing interactive narratives backed by compute from a Jupyter server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout the course of the hackathon, the rate of iterated development for both end users of the community cookbook and the developers of the open-source tooling was astounding. For example, we were able to quickly expose small bugs (
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd/issues/1297" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >e.g. support for HTML video tags&lt;/a>) in the MyST MD tooling, which were immediately fixed upstream and released within minutes. The feedback loop that connected the user experience with the software tooling was incredibly synergistic, with immediate impact both upstream and downstream that 2i2c hopes to continue replicating across many facets of their operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the Project Pythia Cook-off, the breakout group will continue conversations around strengthening their community of practice and hopefully advocating for wider adoption of MyST MD amongst the scientific community (say hello to some of our group members at
&lt;a href="https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >SciPy 2024&lt;/a> in July!).&lt;/p>

See
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/report-czi-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our three-year retrospective&lt;/a> for a report about the growth and impact this service has had.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with several models for funding and sustaining this infrastructure.
We&amp;rsquo;ve tried everything from direct cost-recovery from individual communities, to institutional contracts that cover several hubs, to grant-based models that fund many communities at the same time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are pros and cons associated with each, and we believe that a combination of all of them is important for a long-term service sustainability model for 2i2c.
However, with this post we&amp;rsquo;d like to share the community funding model that strikes the right balance between short-term sustainability and scalability.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In short: 2i2c aims to serve &lt;strong>networks of communities&lt;/strong> that are joined by a domain or workflow, and &lt;strong>fund the network at once&lt;/strong> rather than through one-on-one contracts.&lt;/p>

A model of the funding and service relationships we aim to build.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>We believe that this model strikes a balance between &amp;ldquo;scalable and very simple hubs&amp;rdquo; (which require a lot of administrative toil) and &amp;ldquo;fully bespoke hubs&amp;rdquo; (which are expensive and unscalable).
By using a single funding contract to serve many communities, we can reduce the amount of sales and contracting toil for each community.
This will let us raise funds more quickly, and focus more of our time on delivering service.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/report-czi-2021" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >it&amp;rsquo;s three year retrospective&lt;/a> after closing out its original seed grant.
As part of this process, we&amp;rsquo;re revisiting our organizational strategy, structure, and overall plan, in order to incorporate the learning that we&amp;rsquo;ve done over our first three years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our &lt;strong>value proposition&lt;/strong> is a key framing for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s intended impact, key stakeholders, and platform strategy.
We recently completed a team exercise to refine this statement for 2i2c, and are excited to share it with you below:&lt;/p>

&lt;p class="pull-subtitle">
Our interactive computing platform gives your community a digital home to create and share knowledge, and a global network of communities to learn from.
&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>This is an exciting direction that leans into and builds upon the way we&amp;rsquo;ve described our service so far.
It recognizes that the value in our service doesn&amp;rsquo;t end with simple access to an interactive computing environment, but lies in how that environment&amp;rsquo;s tools empower a community to create and share knowledge with one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe that this is an exciting direction to build towards, because it is based in the value of the collection of communities we serve, and the way that this network can be greater than the sum of its parts.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to lean into this direction in how we shape our platform, what open source contributions we make, and where we aim to have impact in the coming years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To begin, we&amp;rsquo;ve interwoven some ideas from this value proposition into 2i2c.org, and the way that we describe our service.
We&amp;rsquo;d love feedback from anyone who has an idea, a critique, or &amp;ldquo;yes, and&amp;rdquo; to share.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="" >our 2023 report of organizational strengths and weaknesses&lt;/a>, describing some improvements we&amp;rsquo;ve made on our team&amp;rsquo;s coordination and delivery&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2023, we
&lt;a href="" >released a report describing our organizational strengths and weaknesses&lt;/a>.
This uncovered a key challenge for our team: &lt;strong>improving our coordination and delivery&lt;/strong>.
Over the previous two years, our service had grown significantly in its scope and complexity.
We were working on more than 7 active grants and were serving more than 70 active communities with around 7,000 monthly active users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was taxing our small team, and we found ourselves struggling to efficiently deliver on our work.
For example, a
&lt;a href="" >collaboration with GESIS to bring image building functionality to JupyterHub&lt;/a> took longer than we wished, and we felt that our planning and execution was not transparent enough to their team. In addition, in
&lt;a href="https://catalystproject.cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/a> we felt that 2i2c was not responsive enough to onboarding and deploying infrastructure for new communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-weve-taken-to-improve-delivery">
Steps we&amp;rsquo;ve taken to improve delivery
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#steps-weve-taken-to-improve-delivery">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At the beginning of 2024, we hired
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" >our first Delivery Manager and Chief of Staff role&lt;/a> as well as
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" >our first Product Lead role&lt;/a>.
Both of these roles are meant to develop systems and team practices that improve our planning and delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Quarter 1 of 2024, we designed and initiated an organizational transformation with the following goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Provide clarity about our overall organizational goals and strategy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define our near-term goals and major projects that drive our work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define and prioritize the major work items that feed into these goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break this major work items into actionable items that our team can work on from day to day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide visibility for all of this information across the entire organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Below is a brief description of the major changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve made.
These are still a work in progress, and organizational transformation takes months, if not years, but we hope that this provides a useful snapshot in time as we kick off this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-system-of-work">
Our system of work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-system-of-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our team-wide system of work can be found in the Team Compass at the link below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/cross-functional/workflow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >compass.2i2c.org/cross-functional/workflow/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system of work attempts to link our strategic goals with concrete chunks of work to deliver.
You can see an overview of this system below:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-our-work-system-shows-how-initiatives-are-made-up-of-lists-of-actions-that-accomplish-them-these-actions-are-distributed-across-our-teams-operational-boards-for-delivery">

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img alt="Our work system shows how initiatives are made up of lists of actions that accomplish them. These actions are distributed across our team&amp;#39;s operational boards for delivery."

loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Our work system shows how initiatives are made up of lists of actions that accomplish them. These actions are distributed across our team&amp;rsquo;s operational boards for delivery.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It is roughly broken down into these major areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our value proposition&lt;/strong>: Our system of delivery starts with a value proposition.
This is a north-star statement for the value that 2i2c aims to provide to our communities in order to achieve our mission.
It is a guiding principle for where we prioritize our time and improve our service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While updating our delivery model, we decided it was time to update the value proposition we&amp;rsquo;d been informally using.
We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of &lt;em>validating this value proposition with communities&lt;/em>, and will share a draft for public comment soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strategic goals and major projects&lt;/strong>: Next we define strategic goals that describe the most important progress we must make as an organization.
This considers our current capabilities and challenges, as well as the major projects that we&amp;rsquo;re already committed to (like grants).
Our initiatives (described below) should each represent progress towards one or more of our goals and major projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strategic initiatives&lt;/strong>: These are major thrusts of work that represent progress towards our goals.
They range in time from weeks to months, and generally require coordination and action across each of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s functional areas.
Initiatives exist in a dedicated board, where we shape and scope them with enough information to understand them and prioritize.
Once an initiative is in progress, it begins driving work on a two-week planning cycle.
All in-progress initiatives should make up a significant percentage of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s total work allocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Operational boards&lt;/strong>: Operational boards are used to track our day-to-day workstreams.
We organize into two-week sprints, with a collection of work pulled into each sprint according to in-progress initiatives and the other types of reactive and operational work on our plate (for example, responding to support tickets is reactive work).
Within each initiative, we coordinate across our teams in order to understand the next steps needed and who is responsible for doing it.
This helps teams plan the work for their next iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system is very much still a work in progress, and we&amp;rsquo;ve already identified a number of ways that we&amp;rsquo;d like to improve it moving forward.
For example, we&amp;rsquo;d like to find more efficient ways of coordinating across our team, and encouraging team members to own their own work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="changes-to-our-team-culture">
Changes to our team culture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#changes-to-our-team-culture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to our system around planning work, we&amp;rsquo;ve also identified a number of ways that we can improve our team&amp;rsquo;s culture related to work.
As a distributed organization, one of our biggest challenges has been the additional friction that comes with communicating across many time zones.
It&amp;rsquo;s much harder to solve a problem or get help when responses come with long gaps of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, we&amp;rsquo;ve defined several practices that will help our team members grow their autonomy and independence, while still moving towards the same targets and goals.
This is ongoing work that we aim to continue developing over the next few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Professional growth&lt;/strong>.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ve started an audit of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational roles and the responsibilities and the pathways for growth with each of them.
This began with our engineering team, but will continue with other areas of the organization as well.
We believe that defining professional growth trajectories will help identify the gaps in our team&amp;rsquo;s skills that make it more difficult to act efficiently and independently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Giving and receiving feedback&lt;/strong>.
We&amp;rsquo;ve defined team practices around giving feedback, and are encouraging a team culture of regular and constructive feedback to one another.
We know that this will be a long-term investment in team practices, and we believe that any team (especially a distributed one) must be able to rely on its team members to help one another grow.
We&amp;rsquo;ve begun this effort by
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/operations/team-practices/feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >creating a guide to giving feedback for 2i2c&lt;/a> which we hope will be useful for others as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Decision making&lt;/strong>.
We&amp;rsquo;ve defined a
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/operations/governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >set of principles around decision making at 2i2c&lt;/a> that encourage more autonomy and creativity.
In a knowledge-driven field such as ours, it is important that team members have the freedom to be creative and take risks, and that we design systems that are resilient to mistakes.
We aim to make mistakes &lt;em>Safe to Fail&lt;/em> to encourage creativity and learning while de-risking major negative consequences.
This document is a first step towards improving our team-wide practices at taking more initiative and action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Iterative delivery and process improvement&lt;/strong>.
Across each level of the organisation, we have been experimenting more deliberately with Agile delivery practices. These experiments shape our approach to planning (at both the team and organization-level), visualizing and managing our work streams, and improving our internal product delivery processes. We are agnostic to a specific Agile framework, and have found the most value in blending elements of
&lt;a href="https://asana.com/resources/what-is-kanban" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kanban&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Scrum&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://flightlevels.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Flight levels&lt;/a>. We will continue to experiment with these practices, seeking to find a happy medium for 2i2c. We&amp;rsquo;ll share more on this soon :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coaching&lt;/strong>.
Some members of our team have also begun benefiting from having regular 1:1 coaching to help their interpersonal development. Our team&amp;rsquo;s coaching support includes work to empower improving self-awareness, overcoming self-limiting challenges and gaining technical leadership mastery.
Coupled with our growing practices around team feedback, we aim to build a culture where team members have both internal and external support to help them grow.&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;re excited to lean into these challenges and grow as a team, because this is how we can grow the impact of 2i2c and deliver more value for the communities that we serve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security report for jupyter-server-proxy: CVE-2024-28179</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/cve-jupyter-server-proxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/cve-jupyter-server-proxy/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="what-happened">
What happened?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, the JupyterHub team discovered a security vulnerability in
&lt;a href="https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> package&lt;/a> that would allow potential unauthenticated access to a JupyterHub via WebSockets, allowing unauthenticated users to run arbitrary code on the JupyterHub.
&lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> is used by many communities to provide alternative user interfaces like RStudio and remote desktops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This vulnerability was detected by the JupyterHub team, with leadership from 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers. It was resolved through upstream contributions to the JupyterHub project, and we have deployed a fix that mitigates this vulnerability for all the hubs 2i2c manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-this-impact-my-2i2c-community-hub">
Does this impact my 2i2c community hub?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-this-impact-my-2i2c-community-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We do not believe that any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities were impacted by this vulnerability, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/f86d128a0d045163e72802f6df287a6f46d4b738/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L296" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a patch&lt;/a> has now been pushed to all community hubs to resolve this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your community was vulnerable to this problem, you might experience slightly slower startup latency while we work out a long-term solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is a vulnerability in the docker image used by our communities, we will be reaching out over the next few weeks to put a more permanent fix in place.&lt;/p>

Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re grateful that the JupyterHub community was quick to acknowledge, respond, and resolve this security vulnerability after it was brought to their attention.
We&amp;rsquo;re also proud that 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers helped the JupyterHub team throughout the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allowed our team to resolve the problem before it impacted any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities.
Because 2i2c community infrastructure is managed in a central location, we were able to resolve this for over 80 communities with a single team rather than expecting each community to learn about and fix this problem on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also believe this reflects the healthy upstream relationships that we hope to encourage with our team&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Open Source strategy and practices&lt;/a>.
By working with the JupyterHub community and pushing changes upstream, we&amp;rsquo;ve resolved this issue for &lt;em>any&lt;/em> user of &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code>, not just 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s own ecosystem.
In particular, because of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s position running hubs for many communities via Kubernetes, we were able to identify a solution that did not require every user image to be updated (as described in section &lt;strong>For JupyterHub admins of Z2JH installations&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe that all of these lead to a healthier, safer ecosystem of open source tools ❤️.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A three year retrospective report of 2i2c's impact</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/report-czi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/report-czi/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to share a three-year retrospective report that was created to close-out 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s original

&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> is a very popular service that allows end users to specify and share the environment (languages, packages, etc) required for their notebooks to run correctly by placing
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#config-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration files&lt;/a> they are already familiar with (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> or &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>) along with their notebooks. While not without its own set of challenges, this is extremely powerful because it puts control of the &lt;em>environment&lt;/em> in the hands of the people who write the code. They can customize the environment to fit the needs of their code, instead of having to fit their code into the environment that admins have made available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, mybinder.org (and the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a> software that powers it) is built for &lt;em>sharing&lt;/em> your work after you are done with it, &lt;em>not&lt;/em> for actively doing work. BinderHubs often do not have persistent storage nor persistent user identity, and UX is centered around &lt;em>ephemeral&lt;/em> interactivity that can be shared with others (via a link), rather than &lt;em>persistent&lt;/em> interactivity that a single user repeatedly comes back to.
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a> is more commonly used for this kinda workflow, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently have the ability for users to easily build their own environments. Admins who are &lt;em>running&lt;/em> the JupyterHub can make
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#using-multiple-profiles-to-let-users-select-their-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >multiple environments&lt;/a> available for users to choose from, but this still puts admins in the critical path for environment customization.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CESSDA&lt;/a>, aims to bring this flexibility to JupyterHub directly. We aim to empower users to decide for themselves which applications and dependencies are installed on a per-project basis. Our work enables communities with heterogeneous requirements to share a single Hub. Our approach frees administrators from being overwhelmed by installation requests and transforms the JupyterHub platform into a platform for collaborative computational reproducibility. In this update, we report on our progress and upcoming steps in this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">
What does a BinderHub do, exactly?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is helpful to understand that BinderHub primarily has 3 responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Present a UI to the end user for them to provide details on what to build (this is what you see when you go to mybinder.org)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call out to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a> in a scalable way to actually &lt;em>build and push&lt;/em> an image containing the environment for the given repository, and show the user logs as this build process happens. This also allows users to debug issues with their build more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk to a JupyterHub instance to launch a user server with the built docker image, and redirect the user to this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>(2) is really the &lt;em>core&lt;/em> feature of BinderHub, and we settled on figuring out how to make that available to JupyterHub users. It was really important to us that this was also done in a way that can be sustainably used by &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em>, not just 2i2c. This blog post discusses the various improvements to the broad ecosystem of projects in the Jupyter ecosystem to get this done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demo">
Demo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#demo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But first, a very quick demo of how this looks like right now now!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- generated from original .mov screen recording with `ffmpeg -i screencast.mov -c:v libx264 screencast.mp4` -->
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./screencast.mp4" autoplay muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very much a work in progress, but the basic flow can be seen clearly. Users see a Server Options menu after they log into JupyterHub. They can specify the two primary things that determine the server configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The resources allocated (RAM, CPU and maybe GPU)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The environment (container image) used, which can be specified in one of 3 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. A pre-selected list of environments (container images), provided by the administrators who set up this JupyterHub
b. A blank text box where you can enter any publicly available docker image they want
c. A mybinder.org style way to specify a GitHub repository, which will be then dynamically built into a docker image for the user!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what did we need to do to accomplish this, in a way that&amp;rsquo;s very upstream friendly and usable by everyone (and not just 2i2c)?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">
A Standalone &lt;code>binderhub-service&lt;/code> helm chart
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The default upstream
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/tree/main/helm-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a> &lt;em>includes&lt;/em> a JupyterHub as a dependency, and configures itself to be used primarily in a manner similar to
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a>. As the person who helped make that choice early on, I can tell you why it was made - for convenience! And it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> very convenient, as it allowed us to get mybinder.org going fast. However, it makes it difficult to install a BinderHub service &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub. To this end, we have created a standalone
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/binderhub-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a>, designed to be installed &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub, so we can use it &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> to build images. This allows the BinderHub instance to be used as a
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Service&lt;/a>, which is what we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this helm chart is currently under the 2i2c GitHub org, the hope is that it can eventually migrate to a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/519" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-contrib&lt;/a> organization (once it is created), or it can become the upstream helm chart for BinderHub if enough work can be done in BinderHub to allow it to serve use cases like mybinder.org.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this work, we also added a way for BinderHub to run in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1647" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >API only mode&lt;/a>, so we can fully turn off the UI &lt;em>and&lt;/em> launching ability of BinderHub. This change decoupled the
&lt;a href="" >three responsibilities of BinderHub&lt;/a> we discussed previously, allowing us to bring our own UI and JupyterHub. BinderHub could now be used &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> for its scalable image building features, which is exactly what we want!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">
Sustainably extending KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We identified KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> feature as the ideal location for UI to dynamically build environments (container images), making it just another &amp;rsquo;environment choice&amp;rsquo; people can choose, along with picking the resources their server needs. From an end-user perspective, it was also the logical place for them to specify a repository to build into an environment, as they could already choose some pre-built environments from here. They can also select other arbitrary resources they want (such as memory, GPU, etc) from here as well. From a maintainer perspective, it helps with long-term maintenance of the JupyterHub projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation of &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> however, was not easy to extend at this point. So
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/724" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this PR&lt;/a> improved how easy it was to extend it in more complex ways, without making the implementation in KubeSpawner itself complicated. Even though this had &lt;em>no&lt;/em> visible end-user effects, it was an extremely important step in allowing us to experiment with UI in a &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> way without having to rely on upstream. These kinds of changes can sometimes be hard to sell to stakeholders but are extremely important in ensuring a continuous and sustainable relationship with upstream.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">
Implementing &lt;code>unlisted_choice&lt;/code> feature in KubeSpawner
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The profileList feature was built to allow JupyterHub &lt;em>admins&lt;/em> to specify an explicit list of container images the end-user can choose from. It did not have a way for any choice that was &lt;em>not&lt;/em> pre-approved by the admin to be used. We needed this feature since the BinderHub API will build a new docker image for each environment the user wants, and so this can not be chosen from a pre-approved list. We had to safely add this feature to KubeSpawner in such a way that it was generally useful to everyone. Many other communities had been asking for such a feature anyway - the ability to simply &amp;rsquo;type in&amp;rsquo; an image and have that be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA&lt;/a> was one such community, so we partnered with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/batpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sanjay Bhangar&lt;/a> from
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a> (an organization that helps run NASA VEDA) to implement this feature. Engineers from 2i2c contributed heavily to this feature as well, and after &lt;em>several&lt;/em> PRs (
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/735" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >1&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/773" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >3&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/774" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >4&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >5&lt;/a>), this feature is now available for everyone to use!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./screenshot-featured.png" alt="Screenshot of Kubernetes Profiles with Unlisted Choice" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key component of doing &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> upstream work is that every addition needs to be useful by itself for a broad group of people. This change was very helpful for many communities that wanted to allow their users the freedom to pick whatever image they want to use, regardless of wether they wanted to use dynamic image building or not. The broad interest allowed us to build a coalition with other interested parties, and get the change accepted upstream more easily!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhub-fancy-profiles">
&lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-fancy-profiles">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once we had all these pieces in place, it was time to actually work on the frontend UI that would allow users to build images dynamically and launch them. Since this will replace the &amp;lsquo;profileList&amp;rsquo; feature, it should also allow them to select different resources (RAM, CPU, etc) as needed, as well as type in an existing image if they desire. So it was a full re-implementation of the &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> frontend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is ongoing now at the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/a> project. It is a pure frontend web application, using modern frontend tooling (
&lt;a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >React&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >webpack&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Babel&lt;/a>, etc) and written in JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s gone through a few revisions, but the demo provided earlier in the blog post is in its current state. Because the default profileList implementation is pure HTML / CSS with very &lt;em>minimal&lt;/em> JS, it is limited in what kind of UX it could have. &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> aims to be very helpful &lt;em>even&lt;/em> when dynamic image-building features are not enabled on a JupyterHub. We hope to roll this out to a few JupyterHubs and improve it over time based on feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterhub/binderhub-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub/@binderhub-client&lt;/code>&lt;/a> npm package
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While building &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>, we wanted to use the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> javascript code used by BinderHub frontend to interact with the BinderHub API, instead of re-implementing it. However, the existing BinderHub JavaScript code was not easily consumable by external projects. We refactored the code, added tests, migrated to use modern JS practices and published the
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterhub/binderhub-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub/@binderhub-client&lt;/code> NPM package&lt;/a> that can be used not just by &lt;code>jupyerhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> but any external project for talking to the BinderHub API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This had to be done in such a way that current BinderHub installations (such as mybinder.org) do not break. That took quite a few pull requests:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1689" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >1&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1693" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2&lt;/a>,

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#defending-against-cryptojacking-with-cryptnono">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For Open Science to flourish, we need to allow access to resources without login / paywalls wherever possible. A new menace against this has been
&lt;a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Cybercrime/Cryptojacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cryptojacking&lt;/a> - where attackers use up any and all available free compute to mine cryptocurrencies. This has affected &lt;em>many&lt;/em> folks on the internet, including
&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-actions-being-actively-abused-to-mine-cryptocurrency-on-github-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GitHub Actions&lt;/a> and mybinder.org, the primary public BinderHub installation. mybinder.org has some extra protections against cryptojacking that aren&amp;rsquo;t easily usable elsewhere, and this has unfortunately meant that the demo JupyterHubs we have with these features enabled have been behind a login wall. I personally believe login walls are long term antithetical to open science, and so this was an important problem to solve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptnono/cryptnono" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cryptnono&lt;/a> is an open source project designed to help fight cryptojacking, and as part of this grant we ported some of this functionality out of mybinder.org specific code into cryptnono, so other deployments may also benefit from it! We also migrated to using the super efficient
&lt;a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ebpf&lt;/a> Linux Kernel subsystem, allowing for more complex heuristics to catch a much broader range of cryptomining activity. We have been slowly tweaking the config on mybinder.org, and it has proven to be very effective! This will be very helpful for &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> who wants to provide a JupyterHub (or any other computational service) without a login wall. If you are interested in using cryptnono in this fashion, please

&lt;li>Building off of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a>. While this already had a nice UI, it would be hard to port it to run on a distributed Kubernetes environment without it becoming a &amp;lsquo;hard fork&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While these did slow down the implementation of the project, it has allowed us to be very confident that the methods we have chosen are long-term sustainable.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="" >contact me&lt;/a> with your GitHub account if you want access, and promise to not be a cryptominer and you shall be granted access.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Want to set this up on your own JupyterHub? There is some
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/binderhub-service/pull/72" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >work in progress&lt;/a> documentation and more is being worked on. Drop a line in the linked pull request and we&amp;rsquo;ll be happy to help. The eventual goal is for &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> to be able to simply follow documentation and set this up for themselves.&lt;/p>

Future work

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is not complete of course, and there is a lot of future work to be done.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>mybinder.org also helps you distribute your &lt;em>content&lt;/em>, not just the environment for your code to run in. Since JupyterHub usually comes with a persistent home directory for the user,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> is commonly used for this purpose instead. We should explore ways to integrate nbgitpuller (and other ways to distribute content) in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More thorough documentation for how you can recreate what is in the demo for yourself in your own JupyterHub installation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better UX for specifying images, including figuring out how to &amp;lsquo;save&amp;rsquo; them for future reuse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better compatibility with mybinder.org, particularly in allowing other sources of environments (not just GitHub, but Zenodo, raw git repositories, etc) and URL compatibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better authentication workflow between the frontend and the BinderHub API.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>Abstract&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The International Interactive Computing Collaboration (
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org&lt;/a>), working with
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a> and other partners, operates an interactive computing platform for The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center. The U.S. GHG Center,
&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/news-release/nasa-partners-launch-us-greenhouse-gas-center-to-share-climate-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >announced yesterday&lt;/a> at the 28th annual United Nations Climate Conference (COP-28) in Dubai, is an interagency collaboration of the
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)&lt;/a>, the
&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)&lt;/a>, the
&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)&lt;/a>, and the
&lt;a href="https://www.nist.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)&lt;/a>. This note places the launch of the U.S. GHG Center in a scientific, international, and national context and argues that similar digital public goods are needed for humanity to understand and manage the Earth system.&lt;/p>

Scientific Context
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#scientific-context">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It was controversial in 1827 when Joseph Fourier (the discoverer of the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction#Fourier%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >law of heat conduction&lt;/a>) argued &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that the atmosphere keeps the Earth warm, like a puffy down comforter, but it&amp;rsquo;s not now. Gases in the atmosphere trap heat near Earth. How much heat is trapped depends on the gas mixture. Putting more heat-trapping gases in is like putting a wool blanket on top of the down comforter. Human activity since industrialization is injecting lots more heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere and changing the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The science is clear. The up-to-date consensus view of the global scientific community is expressed in the
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sixth Assessment Report&lt;/a> of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The table above describes a subset (for a more systematic review see &lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, &lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>) of key milestones in global efforts to understand and address climate change. A glossary of acronyms and additional background:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The First World Climate Conference (&lt;strong>WCC-1&lt;/strong>) &lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> was held in 1979.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The World Climate Programme (
&lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/programmes/world-climate-programme" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >WCP&lt;/a>), an activity overseen by the
&lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >World Meteorological Organization&lt;/a> was established after WCC-1. WCP, in partnership with other organizations, operates programs (e.g. the
&lt;a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >World Climate Research Program (WCRP)&lt;/a>) that organize and integrate international scientific efforts to understand the climate. The WMO also operates the
&lt;a href="https://ig3is.wmo.int/en/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System (IG3IS)&lt;/a>, a natural partner for the emerging work described below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WCRP manages the
&lt;a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Common Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)&lt;/a>. CMIP serves as a kind of &lt;strong>league for intercomparing models&lt;/strong> of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate system developed by teams who approach the problems with different methods and designs. Intercomparison, an approach that enables finding the consensus views of teams with divergent approaches to problems, is used in other modeling scenarios.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research papers on the climate are rapidly produced by scholars from essentially all knowledge disciplines. This overwhelming stream of content, like snowflakes in a blizzard, is coalesced into coherent and carefully scrutinized &lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >IPCC Assessment Reports&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> by the
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Earth Summit&lt;/a> held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 led to the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)&lt;/a>. The UNFCCC is an international treaty that recognizes the dangers to the climate system caused by human activity, calls for ongoing study, and establishes recurring
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Conference of the Parties (COP)&lt;/a> meetings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/event/cop-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-3 (Kyoto)&lt;/a> led to the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kyoto Protocol Treaty&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrd%E2%80%93Hagel_Resolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Byrd-Hagel Resolution&lt;/a> was a unanimous United States Senate Resolution that stipulated the United States would not sign treaties promising greenhouse gas reductions by developed countries that did not mandate similar reductions from developing countries. This killed USA participation in the Kyoto Protocol Treaty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Paris Agreement&lt;/a>, established at
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/event/cop-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-21 (Paris)&lt;/a>, effectively replaces the Kyoto Protocol, includes specifications by participant countries on greenhouse gas reductions called &lt;em>National Determined Contributions&lt;/em> (NDCs). The United States entered the Paris Agreement under President Obama, exited under President Trump and rejoined under President Biden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop26" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-26 (Glasgow)&lt;/a>established an accountability system for the Paris Agreement called the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/FAQ-moving-towards-the-ETF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)&lt;/a>. Participant countries to the Paris Agreement will
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/preparing-for-the-ETF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >submit their first Biennial Transparency Reports (BTR1) under the ETF&lt;/a> in 2024.&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually releases&lt;/a> the &lt;em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks&lt;/em> reports. These reports are submitted to the United Nations in accordance with the UNFCCC. The EPA
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/greenhouse-gas-inventory-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >openly shares&lt;/a> software, tools, data, and

The IWG, renamed as the
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/sc_co2_tsd_august_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases in 2016&lt;/a>, synthesizes research on
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >integrated assessment modelling&lt;/a> to quantify the dollar costs associated to damage caused by an incremental increase in GHG emissions in a given year. Quantifying the impacts of GHG emissions in monetary terms is vital to effective rulemaking across the Federal Government. This
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/social_cost_of_carbon_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >EPA fact sheet on the social costs of carbon&lt;/a> provides further background. A 2017 consensus report &lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> of the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) offered recommendations for ongoing research to improve the assignment of social costs to GHG emissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other federal agencies have developed expertise, data, and analyses that give insights into GHG emissions that compliment and potentially extend the &lt;em>Inventory&lt;/em> reports developed annually by the EPA. How should the United States integrate federal agency efforts to monitor and measure greenhouse gas emissions? A 2022 NASEM consensus report &lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> investigated this question. In January of this year, the
&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/01/06/biden-harris-administration-releases-new-guidance-to-disclose-climate-impacts-in-environmental-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Biden Administration&lt;/a> released guidance&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> for federal agencies on incorporating GHG emissions information in policies and reports. Shortly thereafter, a draft federal strategy to advance an integrated greenhouse gas monitoring system was
&lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bDDD1BC85-9276-8FB7-C362-A00E3E427E0D%7d&amp;amp;path=&amp;amp;method=init" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >released by NASA with a request for public input&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some important insights from the NASEM consensus report, the draft federal strategy, and the IWG reports:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Data streams on greenhouse gas emissions can be sorted into two broad categories:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Activity-based:&lt;/strong> Activity-based data, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; data, quantify GHG emissions by measuring activities that generate GHG emissions. Economic or business activity data (gallons of diesel sold in a county on Tuesday; miles flown by a 747 in October) can be converted into quantified GHG emissions information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atmospheric-based:&lt;/strong> Atmosphere-based data, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;top-down&amp;rdquo; data, quantify GHG emissions by performing atmospheric measurements. For example, the
&lt;a href="https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO2)&lt;/a> remotely senses $CO_2$ from space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A hybrid approach that blends activity-based and atmospheric-based GHG data has the potential to provide new insights.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Interoperable and easily accessed tools and data products for analyzing GHG emissions information and assigning costs should be made available across the Federal government.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GHG emissions information is needed in scenarios outside the international context of participating nations reporting for UNFCCC and Paris Agreement ETF compliance:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subnational governments&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; cities, states, provinces, counties &amp;ndash; want GHG data products to measure their progress on emission reduction programs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Facilities&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; harbours, toll roads, power plants, factories, universities &amp;ndash; similarly want GHG data products.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Companies&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; airlines, trucking, construction &amp;ndash; want GHG data products.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reliable and transparent GHG emissions information is required to enable effective environmental-social-governance (ESG) investment without “greenwashing”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accurate and improving quantifications of the social costs associated to GHG emissions require ongoing research.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>How much GHG emission is generated through oil and gas production? How much GHG emission is generated by urban centers? Do landfills contribute significant GHG emissions? How do human-generated GHG emissions compare to natural sources of GHG emissions?

Instead of building a walled garden with proprietary technology from a vendor selected through RFP, the Center launched a prototype platform using curated open source tools integrated with public federal data.

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Research, data and recommendations developed by scientists and engineers that influence policies set by democratic governments should be accessible by voters. No entity should own the ways humans communicate and learn about the Earth system. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center&amp;rsquo;s generous approach to digital infrastructure &amp;ndash; an open toolchain adjacent to open data &amp;ndash; is vital for democracy and should be replicated across government agencies worldwide.&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to experiment with a &lt;strong>monthly community update&lt;/strong> to create a regular cadence of transparency and highlights from 2i2c for our broader community.
This is the first such update, so bear with us as we work out the kinks!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal with these updates is to share what stands out at 2i2c - what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned, what we&amp;rsquo;re proud of, where we&amp;rsquo;ve struggled, and where we&amp;rsquo;ve had an impact.
We hope this can be a historical record of &amp;ldquo;what stands out&amp;rdquo; to our team and that it is useful for our broader community to see.
We also want this to be relatively short and to the point to make it sustainable to both write and read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;d love feedback&lt;/strong> on what else you&amp;rsquo;d like to see.
If you have any ideas, please send an email to &lt;code>hello@2i2c.org&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="rough-numbers">
Rough Numbers
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#rough-numbers">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off, a few numbers on the scale and status of our interactive computing hub service:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are currently running around &lt;strong>73 JupyterHubs&lt;/strong> that are collectively averaging more than &lt;strong>4000 average monthly users&lt;/strong>.
We have several communities in the educational sector, so October was a peak in the Fall semester of activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re recovering roughly &lt;strong>40% of our monthly staffing costs through recurring service revenue&lt;/strong>.
The remainder we&amp;rsquo;re making up with a combination of grants and more focused development contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming minimal growth in our service and fundraising, our &lt;strong>runway is roughly until August 2025&lt;/strong> - however, we anticipate this to shrink in the short-term once we make critical new hires in the coming months.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="organization-updates">
Organization Updates
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#organization-updates">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>This section describes some major organization-wide efforts we&amp;rsquo;ve started or progressed over the last month.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="improving-our-quarterly-sprints-and-goals">
Improving Our Quarterly Sprints and Goals
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#improving-our-quarterly-sprints-and-goals">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This month our team kicked off the second round of our new quarterly sprints and goals process.
This is an attempt to focus our team around a few goals and sub-teams dedicated to them throughout each quarter.
Our hope is that this allows us to make strategic &amp;ldquo;pushes&amp;rdquo; in directions that feel important for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s operations and the communities we serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This quarter, we incorporated a lot of learning that took place after our first iteration in Q3 2023.
We are hoping to sharpen up the timing of events throughout the process, including communicating internally and externally about our status (thus, this blog post series).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next quarter, we aim to build off of this work, and to identify where our future new hires of
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" >Delivery Manager / Interim Chief of Staff&lt;/a> and our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" >Product Lead&lt;/a> will fit in.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="three-new-jobs-posted">
Three New Jobs Posted
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#three-new-jobs-posted">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In October, we began a short hiring push to address many of the organizational challenges noted in
&lt;a href="" >our organizational structure and strategy audit&lt;/a>.
We aim to have each of these positions filled by the end of the year and begin incorporating new team members into our organization.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the three job postings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" >Delivery Manager / Interim Chief of Staff&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" >Product Lead&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="product-strategy-work">
Product Strategy Work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#product-strategy-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We kicked off a collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://richardpope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Richard Pope&lt;/a> to provide us with some short-term product strategy work.
In Q3, our team took stock of the many different kinds of services and technology that we deploy, aiming to refine this into a long-term product model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Richard will join us for several months to take these outputs and help us craft them into a model for where 2i2c is delivering value that we can build upon for the coming years.
We&amp;rsquo;ll provide more updates for the community as this work continues.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="continued-onboarding-of-communities-in-our-catalyst-project-collaboration">
Continued Onboarding of Communities in Our Catalyst Project Collaboration
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#continued-onboarding-of-communities-in-our-catalyst-project-collaboration">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We continued onboarding communities onto infrastructure managed by 2i2c as part of a
&lt;a href="" >CZI-funded project to serve communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/a>.
The grant team began its operations last April and spent the first several months creating an onboarding pipeline and rubric for identifying and connecting with communities.
As of October, we&amp;rsquo;ve onboarded our first few communities - there is still a lot of content, training material, and documentation to create, and we will begin iterating on this in collaboration with our early-adopted communities in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="partnerships-and-impact">
Partnerships and Impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#partnerships-and-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>This section describes notable new partnerships and developments with communities in our interactive computing hub service.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We began several new partnerships with communities in the research space this month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis (VEDA)&lt;/a> project is an open-source science cyberinfrastructure for data processing, visualization, exploration, and geographic information systems (GIS) capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://us-ghg-center.github.io/ghgc-docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >US Greenhouse Gas Center&lt;/a> provides a cloud-based system for exploring and analyzing U.S. government and other curated greenhouse gas datasets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve celebrated considerable growth in one of our partner communities:
&lt;a href="https://cryointhecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a>.
This community focuses its work around studying the Cryosphere using satellite imagery data.
They&amp;rsquo;ve grown their community hub to roughly 300 users in a year and have piloted several novel interfaces for data analysis in a JupyterHub context, such as using
&lt;a href="https://qgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGIS&lt;/a> via a Linux desktop browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c team members also gave several talks in October, and you can find links to each of these below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-weve-learned-and-what-stood-out">
What We&amp;rsquo;ve Learned and What Stood Out
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-weve-learned-and-what-stood-out">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>These are things that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in the past month that we&amp;rsquo;re using to improve our service moving forward&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Communities like to define and select their own environments&lt;/strong>.
We began rolling out new functionality to allow communities to &lt;strong>define their user environments on-the-fly&lt;/strong>.
This brings mybinder.org-style environment creation into a JupyterHub, and gives both more control and more visibility into the environments that communities use.
We noticed that this also begins to blur the line between different workflows and types of communities that can be served on a single hub.
It means that a hub is no longer strictly tied to a small number of user environments created for it.
We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the implications of this in the coming months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We need to improve our billing and invoicing infrastructure&lt;/strong>.
This month we began going through another backlog of cloud infrastructure invoices to send out to communities.
For many communities, 2i2c pays a cloud bill on their behalf and passes through costs directly to them.
This allows them to know exactly what they&amp;rsquo;re paying for.
However, it is also starting to generate a lot of work!
We aim to explore ways to automate and standardize this process in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Digital Public Goods is a concept that resonates with many community leaders&lt;/strong>.
Jim and Chris both gave talks that leaned heavily into the notion of open tools and services as &amp;ldquo;Digital Public Goods&amp;rdquo;.
As public goods, it is important that they remain &amp;ldquo;driven by the public&amp;rdquo; and that they have sustainable and scalable models to grow the value that these goods provide.
We&amp;rsquo;ve noted that this topic resonates heavily with people across the research and education spectrum, and we&amp;rsquo;re considering how to lean into these values more heavily in 2i2c.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open organizational report: Strengths and challenges for 2i2c's team</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the last several months 2i2c has been working with an organizational consulting group called
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Difference Digital&lt;/a> to help us identify the major opportunities and challenges in our organizational structure and strategy.
The result of this work is a report that describes in detail the major strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities that 2i2c faces. It also recommends major actions to take as an organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c values organizational transparency and a willingness to be honest about where you&amp;rsquo;re struggling.
Stress is a natural part of both individuals and organizations, and should be embraced with the goal of learning and improving.
Moreover, as a young organization 2i2c has benefitted heavily from the documents and learning that &lt;em>other&lt;/em> organizations have made publicly available.
We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where we are without building on the backs of others who are willing to share what they&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we are making this organizational audit and report public for anyone to see.
We hope that it provides transparency into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s current status, and that it serves as a useful resource for other non-profits that are growing and facing similar challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10081003" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the report on Zenodo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more background on this report, check out the short description below.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In April of this year we had our first in-person team meeting.
We were excited and grateful to have the opportunity to speak to each other face-to-face.
We also learned that many people on our team were stressed out!
Our service had grown slow-but-steadily over the previous year, and we were feeling the tension that comes with growing your partnerships without significantly changing your team&amp;rsquo;s capacity or structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to work with an organizational consulting group called
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >makeadifference.digital&lt;/a> to help us identify where we need to make improvements.
They spent several weeks having one-on-one conversations with each member of the team, as well as doing a broader organizational analysis and comparison to other technical organizations at a similar stage of their lifecycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result of this work was a report that outlines the major opportunities and strengths, as well as challenges and gaps in capacity, that our team currently faces.
It makes a number of recommendations for how we should shift our practices, and importantly it also notes that the only way to gain that capacity is by hiring for new people and skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10081003" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the report on Zenodo&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The immediate result of this work is that we currently have three jobs posted:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" >A Product Lead role&lt;/a> to help us build a &amp;ldquo;product function&amp;rdquo; within 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" >A Delivery Manager / Chief of Staff role&lt;/a> to oversee and manage 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s system of work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/23qq4-open-source-infrastructure-engineer/" >A cloud and operations engineering role&lt;/a> to grow our cloud engineering team&amp;rsquo;s capacity in serving communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our next steps are to fill these positions, and to then begin the work of implementing many of the recommendations that are contained in the report.
We&amp;rsquo;re confident that this is a natural part of being a small and growing organization, and we are grateful for the expertise of
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >makeadifference.digital&lt;/a> in guiding us through this work.&lt;/p>

In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work serving and growing our interactive computing service, as well as doing some introspection as a team and identifying major next steps moving forward.
More on that in the following sections, but first a short service update.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-has-our-service-evolved-over-the-past-few-months">
How has our service evolved over the past few months?

&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="new-partnerships-and-service-growth">
New partnerships and service growth
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-partnerships-and-service-growth">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our service has grown several new partner communities over the last two quarters. A few notable communities are
&lt;a href="https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the NASA VEDA project&lt;/a>, a
&lt;a href="https://smithsonian.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >team at the Smithsonian&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://ncar-cisl.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a team at NCAR&lt;/a>, and the
&lt;a href="https://hub.ghg.center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >U.S. Greenhouse Gases Center&lt;/a>. We are running about &lt;strong>71 hubs across 24 clusters, with about 4000 weekly users&lt;/strong> (
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/kpis/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >more usage stats here&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also began operations on a major collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa, called
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7025288" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Catalyst Project&lt;/a>.
This team met together for the first time in April, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been laying a foundation for service growth in the first several months.
We are just onboarding our first communities and hope to grow that service in the coming year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to receive some grants around creating content and designing workflows that utilize cloud infrastructure. For example, a
&lt;a href="https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/open-science-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA TOPS grant&lt;/a> and an upcoming collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia&lt;/a> around geospatial workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="financial-picture">
Financial picture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#financial-picture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>recovering roughly 40% of our operating costs&lt;/strong> through recurring fees of our managed hub service (making up the remainder in development contracts and grants), and &lt;strong>we&amp;rsquo;ve currently got around 2 years of runway&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, both of these will be lowered soon because we are about to hire for several more positions.
Improvements to our product model will allow us to estimate and recover our service costs more effectively, but we also intend to raise some funds next year to support our efforts in making our service more robust, sustainable, and valuable to communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to strike a proper balance of team (and cost) growth against the financial buffer needed to assure your partners you&amp;rsquo;ll stick around, but we&amp;rsquo;re confident that the new hires described below will serve critical needs for our team and mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more context on why and how we&amp;rsquo;re trying to make up that capacity, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">
How service growth can lead to team stress
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve had a slow-but-steady stream of new communities interested in working with 2i2c for managing cloud infrastructure for interactive computing.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s make it work somehow&amp;rdquo; approach to all of our community partnerships thus far, with the idea that we must use these partnerships to learn what communities want and identify common patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exciting, and we&amp;rsquo;re fortunate to see the interest and growth in our service.
It suggests to us that something about our model is fundamentally right.
Communities really love the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a>, and our participatory service model based around upstream contributions, transparency, and shared responsibility is attractive to many in research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, each new community is also a new set of stresses on the technical and social infrastructure of our team.
Without the capacity to manage the demands of the service, you run the risk of over-extending &amp;ndash; and in a worst case scenario, burning out &amp;ndash; your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This became clear in our first in-person team meeting last May.
At that meeting, we realized that many on the team were spending too much of their time &amp;ldquo;reacting&amp;rdquo; to demands from the service.
We also learned that the scope and complexity of our various workstreams had gotten to a size where our informal team structures of work prioritization were no longer adequate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">
Growing the complexity of our team to match the complexity of our service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, for the past several months we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a plan to evolve 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team structure in order to more effectively manage the complexity of our service, and balance long- and short-term thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This began with an organizational audit carried out by
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>, a consulting group that focuses on tech-for-good and non-profit products and services.
They conducted interviews with everybody on the team, and concluded that we have a few key functions missing that were creating or compounding the stresses people felt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope to make some of their key findings public soon (Update: this is now available at
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/" >this blog post about the organizational report&lt;/a>), and in the meantime here is an overview of some highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">
We need a dedicated product functionality
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>First, we realized that we have a number of new &amp;ldquo;signals&amp;rdquo; pushing our service in many different directions.
Some are external - from communities we work with or from funders. Some are internal - from different team member visions of where work is needed.
After growing our service and our team, there are now too many perspectives and voices to balance in an unstructured and purely organic way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>dedicated &amp;ldquo;product function&amp;rdquo; within 2i2c&lt;/strong>.
Its goal will be to serve as an integrator across the many stakeholders that are interested in 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s service, and synthesize a collective product strategy and system of prioritization to move the organization forward.
They&amp;rsquo;ll help 2i2c grow a culture of iteration and decisions that are driven by the needs of our community partners and users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >hiring a Product Lead&lt;/a> to kick off this effort.
If you think you&amp;rsquo;d be interested in this role, please consider applying!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-a-more-structured-system-of-work-and-execution">
We need a more structured system of work and execution
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-more-structured-system-of-work-and-execution">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Next, we realized that there are many different workstreams we must balance simultaneously.
There are new communities to be onboarded, infrastructure bugs to be fixed, questions to be answered, and strategic priorities to improve the service.
Expecting each team member to individually find the right balance between all of these is increasingly unrealistic.
We need capacity to oversee this system of work and bring some structure to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>Delivery Manager role&lt;/strong> to oversee the system of work that our engineering team uses for its planning and execution.
In addition, this role will serve at an organization-wide capacity as an &lt;strong>interim Chief of Staff&lt;/strong>.
This will allow them to improve and standardize practices organization-wide, and coordinate major projects that span our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >job posting for a Delivery Manager / interrim Chief of Staff&lt;/a> role.
If you think you&amp;rsquo;d be interested, please apply!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-more-capacity-to-support-our-team-and-its-individuals">
We need more capacity to support our team and its individuals
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-capacity-to-support-our-team-and-its-individuals">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to moving forward our workstreams, we also have a unique challenge in team support and dynamics.
2i2c is a small team, it is also distributed across 10 time zones!
This adds a lot of extra challenge in getting the team to communicate with one another, support one another as individuals, and learn and grow as a team.
We believe that it&amp;rsquo;s critical to support one another, and to have systems in 2i2c that recognize these challenges in distributed collaboration to design around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re exploring how to create a &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;People Operations&amp;rdquo; function within 2i2c&lt;/strong> that can dedicate their time to supporting 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team as a group as individuals.
This might mean defining creative ways for team-building, creating mechanisms to surface where team members are struggling or need support, and growing best-practices in inclusive asynchronous team culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of designing this role, and hope to have it out in the coming months!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-more-engineering-capacity">
We need more engineering capacity
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-engineering-capacity">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, we also realized we need more cloud engineering capacity on our team, particularly in a timezone that overlaps with the American continents.
This will give our team a bit more breathing room to balance reactive and project-based work, and have more capacity to focus on personal growth and learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find our

&lt;h2 id="whats-up-next-for-our-team">
What&amp;rsquo;s up next for our team?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-up-next-for-our-team">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve also adopted a new quarterly planning system to align our team around key goals that deserve focused attention in each quarter.
This will let us be more intentional about considering our work in the context of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s broader opportunities and challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the final quarter of 2023, we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on these key goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Begin to standardize and refine our product offering&lt;/strong>.
In advance of our Product Lead role, we are doing a bit of work to more precisely describe and structure our &lt;em>current&lt;/em> service offering.
Our goal is to lay a foundation that our upcoming Product Lead can then use to learn about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s product and make progress more quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pay down technical debt&lt;/strong>.
Our engineering team is going to focus on streamlining their operations and reducing toil, in order to reduce the number of &amp;ldquo;unexpected distractions&amp;rdquo; that come with inefficient infrastructure and processes.
It will also make the service more reliable and transparent for our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build foundational resources for hub champions to support their community.&lt;/strong>
Our Partnerships team will lead an effort to build basic infrastructure and content that communities can use to create their own knowledge bases around hubs. This will be ongoing work so the goal here is to create a foundation to build upon in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We hope that this has been an informative update from our team, and we appreciate everybody&amp;rsquo;s input and collaboration over the past few months.
We think that the tensions described in this post are healthy - they&amp;rsquo;re reflective of an organization that is growing and reaching organizational milestones.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to tackle them and to continue growing our impact and partnerships.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Color is the first visual thing we remember and a powerful asset in building brand recognition.
Our color is blue.
Our community blue says the sky is not the limit. It&amp;rsquo;s energetic and vibrant, just like the community we serve.
And it&amp;rsquo;s our primary colour, supported by a lively secondary palette that&amp;rsquo;s as at home on digital platforms as it is on billboards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve chosen two fonts to use in the majory of the text that we write.
&lt;code>Poppins&lt;/code> for big, bold sentences, and &lt;code>Work Sans&lt;/code> for more versatile and everyday use.&lt;/p>

We&amp;rsquo;ll try and think of creative ways to incorporate them into our visual style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe our new visual identity is more than just a fresh coat of paint.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reaffirmation of our commitment to our stakeholders and an exciting milestone in our ongoing journey.
We can&amp;rsquo;t wait for you to see it in action, and are excited to hear what you think about it!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>JupyterHub is a versatile platform that can serve a desktop with Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software in the cloud. This was demonstrated by the QGreenland Researcher Workshop that was hosted by the NASA CryoCloud hub. The hands-on workshop trained 25-30 researchers, from Germany, India, France, Canada, Poland and the United States, on how to work with geospatial data in an open science framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="qgreenland-overview">
QGreenland Overview
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#qgreenland-overview">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://qgreenland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGreenland&lt;/a> is an open-source geospatial data package designed for QGIS, a community-owned GIS platform. It focuses on Greenland, offering researchers and educators a comprehensive toolset for FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) data analysis. The package integrates a variety of datasets into a single, easy-to-use data-viewing and analysis platform, supporting both offline and online use. This makes it particularly valuable for remote fieldwork and areas with limited internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workshop-success">
Workshop Success
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#workshop-success">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The QGreenland workshop demonstrated several key benefits of using JupyterHub for cloud-based GIS:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Accessibility: Participants from across the world could access the same powerful GIS tools through a web browser, eliminating the need for complex local installations while enhancing reproducibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud block storage: Using a JupyterHub in the cloud allowed for faster data access than a traditional NFS file store by provisioning each user with an elastic block store disk, reducing load times from 5 minutes to under 3 seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cost Efficiency: Utilizing the CryoCloud JupyterHub instance managed by 2i2c drastically cut down setup costs and time, with only minimal cloud operating expenses of roughly $1/person/day.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The success of the QGreenland workshop underscores the potential of integrating interactive software applications in JupyterHub. This approach not only democratizes access to advanced geospatial tools but also fosters a collaborative research environment. We look forward to supporting more workshops for QGreenland in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This quarter we grew our engineering team significantly, and started to refine our team processes and structures to accommodate this extra complexity.
We expanded our managed cloud service with new community partners, and made a number of improvements to our technical infrastructure and organizational processes for managing this service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read on below to learn more about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-community-partnerships">
New community partnerships
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-community-partnerships">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We added several new community partnerships to our managed hub service.
We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed new hub infrastructure for each of the following groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our
&lt;a href="https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >University of Toronto Jupyter service&lt;/a> now has a dedicated R hub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.drakkar-ocean.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Drakkar Ocean project&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA Visuaslization Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/quantifiedcarbon/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QuantifiedCarbon&lt;/a> organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://oceanhackweek.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OceanHackWeek 2023&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We onboarded several new community colleges to our &amp;ldquo;JupyterHubs Education in Community Colleges&amp;rdquo; collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://www.cloudbank.org/welcome-cloudbank" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CloudBank&lt;/a> and

Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Below are a few highlights for ways in which we improved our
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Managed Cloud Service&lt;/a> for our partner communities.&lt;/p>

We simplified our authentication workflow with CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-simplified-our-authentication-workflow-with-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Authentication services allow us to identify a user when they log onto a hub, which determines their ability to access hub resources.
Previously we had used a combination of
&lt;a href="https://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Auth0&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CILogon&lt;/a>, or
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/hub-deployment-guide/configure-auth/github-orgs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GitHub&lt;/a> for authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with our use of CILogon so far, especially because of its non-profit status and alignment with many research and education institutions that we work with.
This quarter, we decided to streamline our authentication process by dropping the use of Auth0 and grow our partnership with CILogon.&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-exposed-user-activity-dashboards-in-jupyterhub-so-communities-know-how-many-people-are-using-the-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We tend to work with &lt;em>leaders&lt;/em> of communities that utilize our service and infrastructure for many others in their network.
For example, a teacher with a classroom of students, or a researcher with a global network of collaborators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to track how many users are actively using a platform over various metrics of time.
This can tell you whether your community finds a service useful, and whether this is growing or shrinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use
&lt;a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Grafana&lt;/a> to automatically generate dashboards of activity for all of our community hubs and clusters.
However, tracking &lt;strong>daily, weekly, and monthly active users&lt;/strong> was not part of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s core functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to upstream this functionality into JupyterHub and expose it via
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the JupyterHub Grafana project&lt;/a>.
All 2i2c hubs now track daily, weekly, and monthly unique active users.
And importantly, anybody else deploying the

&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kubernetes&lt;/a> is at the core of our cloud infrastructure and scalability.
We use either a shared or a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for each of our community partners, and it is the foundation upon which all of their Jupyter infrastructure rests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest challenges with managing an ongoing cloud service is keeping the underlying infrastructure upgraded.
This brings in new stability and functionality, but also often involves manual steps and toil.
This quarter, we upgraded each of our AWS JupyterHubs to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kubernetes 1.24&lt;/a> and will continue this effort with other providers in the coming quarters.&lt;/p>

About CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#about-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CILogon&lt;/a> is an open source service provider that allows users to log in against over 4000 various identity providers, including campus identity providers. The available identity providers are members of
&lt;a href="https://incommon.org/federation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >InCommon&lt;/a>, a federation of universities and other organizations that provide single sign-on access to various resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cilogon-and-2i2c">
CILogon and 2i2c
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cilogon-and-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For the past year, 2i2c has been successfully using CILogon for more than fifteen of the hubs it manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of the hubs that use it are hubs for communities in education that want to manage their hub access through their own institutional providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With using a tool like CILogon, we allow hub access to be managed both through the communities&amp;rsquo; institutional providers, but also through social providers like GitHub and Google. Because both authentication mechanisms can coexist, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to provide specific credentials for 2i2c staff in order to have access to the hub. This reduces both the burden on institution&amp;rsquo;s IT departments, but also the complexity of a hub deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, as we migrate away from our current Auth0 setup, the number of hubs using CILogon will further increase in the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-setup">
The setup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-setup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The setup that 2i2c uses, is based on two important tools, the CILogon administrative client and the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-cilogon-administrative-client">
The CILogon administrative client
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cilogon-administrative-client">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c administrative client&lt;/a> provided by CILogon allowed us to automatically manage the CILogon OAuth applications needed for authenticating into the hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For each hub that uses CILogon, we dynamically create an OAuth
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >client application&lt;/a> in CILogon and store the credentials safely, using the script at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/3312f373f0aa59fbc98dc1c8161aa9623b68726b/deployer/cilogon_app.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cilogon_app.py&lt;/a>. The script can also used for &lt;code>updating&lt;/code> the callback URLs of an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>deleting&lt;/code> a CILogon OAuth application when a hub is removed or changes authentication methods, &lt;code>getting&lt;/code> details about an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>getting all&lt;/code> existing 2i2c CILogon OAuth applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-jupyterhub-cilogonoauthenticator">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For CILogon&amp;rsquo;s integration with JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s authentication workflow, we&amp;rsquo;re using the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/blob/main/oauthenticator/cilogon.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>CILogonOAuthenticator&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, which is part of the
&lt;a href="https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub OAuthenticator project&lt;/a>. This is what allows JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers for authentication, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a base for writing other Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this 2i2c integration with the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator some important upstream fixes and enhancements to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>oauthenticator&lt;/code>&lt;/a> were identified and performed. For example, the

See
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our open source policy documentation&lt;/a> for the product of this brainstorm.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past year the 2i2c team has focused its efforts on deploying, configuring, running, and managing cloud infrastructure that supports open source workflows in research and education. We&amp;rsquo;ve also done a lot of &lt;em>upstream contribution&lt;/em> as a part of our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we have shied away from taking direct funding for direct development work in open source projects. This is for two primary reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Our focus has been on managing cloud infrastructure, not developing it. We want to facilitate access to open workflows in interactive computing, which is a different skillset and kind of work than &lt;em>creating&lt;/em> those tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While 2i2c is aligned with the interests of open communities, we are still a distinct organization with our own mission and strategy. We want to be conscious that 2i2c team members have &lt;em>more than one hat&lt;/em>, and that their 2i2c hat is necessarily not the same thing as their open source hat. As such, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to leverage our &amp;ldquo;other hats&amp;rdquo; to drive resources to 2i2c without being thoughtful about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In the last year we&amp;rsquo;ve found that running infrastructure for research and education gives us great visibility into the kinds of things that these communities want to do, and ways to improve the infrastructure. It also means we can potentially be a conduit of &lt;em>resources&lt;/em> from those communities into open source development workflows. For example, we recently
&lt;a href="" >partnered with GESIS to make improvements in Binder and JupyterHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this post is a brainstorm to identify some of the major considerations that we should take before agreeing to this kind of work. Its goals is to drive policy that streamlines our ability to seek and accept funding for open source work. It tries to answer this question:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can a stakeholder accept funding on behalf of an open source community in a way that is inclusive, equitable, and effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="some-assumptions">
Some assumptions
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#some-assumptions">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off I want to note that this only applies to open source projects that I&amp;rsquo;d call &amp;ldquo;Open communities&amp;rdquo;. For example, those that follow
&lt;a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the principles of open scholarly infrastructure&lt;/a>. The ideas here don&amp;rsquo;t apply to open source projects that are run by single organizations or people. You can assume I&amp;rsquo;m talking about projects that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Have inclusive multi-stakeholder governance and operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Care about having a broad contributor and leadership base, and want to follow best-practices in inclusive and equitable operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Need funding to drive major new efforts, or to sustain pre-existing maintenance and community management work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Why is this important? In short, because open projects should care about good governance, and about building sustainable and diverse multi-stakeholder communities around their operations and strategy. While it&amp;rsquo;s easy to ignore these considerations and just bring in money however you can (open source is perpetually under-funded, after all), it&amp;rsquo;s crucial that we think about how to do so in a way that aligns with the values of open communities, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t simply propagate a &amp;ldquo;rich get richer&amp;rdquo; dynamic. Ultimately, the unique value of open communities is not in the technology they create, but in the &lt;em>way that they create it&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr-an-overview-of-major-considerations">
&lt;code>tl;dr&lt;/code>: An overview of major considerations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#tldr-an-overview-of-major-considerations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After working with several open source projects over the years, there are a few issues that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come up again and again. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary and I&amp;rsquo;ll note each in more detail below.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Governance&lt;/strong>: funding should &lt;em>follow&lt;/em> major decisions, not make them. It should represent the interests of the project rather than those of a single stakeholder or payer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Transparency&lt;/strong>: stakeholders that accept funding should be transparent in their &lt;em>accounting&lt;/em> (the sources of funding, deliverables attached with it, and operational costs), their &lt;em>plans&lt;/em> (the work they plan to do and how they want to do it) and in their &lt;em>strategy&lt;/em> (the reason they&amp;rsquo;re applying for funding in the first place, and how the work fits in with their other operations).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accountability&lt;/strong>: stakeholders that accept funding should be accountable to the open communities that they are supporting. There should be mechanisms for open communities to provide feedback about and influence their operations, ideally in a powerful position like a board seat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equity&lt;/strong>: funding should be shared with others in the project, particularly those that need it or that couldn&amp;rsquo;t get funding on their own. Moreover, people should be paid for their time - if funding requires work from others, they should be compensated somehow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inclusion&lt;/strong>: funding &lt;em>opportunities&lt;/em> should be shared with others in a project, particularly those from historically disadvantaged communities. Stakeholders with funding &amp;ldquo;connections&amp;rdquo; should use them to boost others in the community as &lt;em>partners&lt;/em>, not just as contractors&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is a more in-depth discussion of each below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="governance-funding-should-follow-decisions">
Governance: funding should follow decisions
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#governance-funding-should-follow-decisions">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As a general rule, &lt;strong>funding should not be a decision&lt;/strong>, it should only be fuel that helps &lt;strong>execute a decision that has already been made&lt;/strong> by the community. Moreover, responsibilities attached to funding should only be given to people with the power to actually carry them out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common mistake that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in open communities is when funding &lt;em>creates&lt;/em> an unintended decision on behalf of many others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a new funder shows up with an agenda and offers it to a subset of maintainers. Those maintainers accept, implicitly making a decision to do the bidding of the funder (this could be a grant, a contract, etc). They begin doing the work, and run into resistance from &lt;em>other&lt;/em> maintainers who weren&amp;rsquo;t on-board with these changes in the first place. This creates a stressful situation where one party has legally committed to doing some work, but they may not have the buy-in from others in the community to let it happen. This is particularly problematic when the funding commitment was not advertised publicly to others in the project early on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to ensure that funding is aligned with good governance principles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make it clear who is allowed to accept money for a project&lt;/strong>. First and foremost, projects should be explicit about who is allowed to accept money that involves doing open source work for them (e.g., only steering council members can approve new funding). Moreover, they should define basic policies about how that money can be used (e.g. does the project have a cap on the amount that can be paid to individuals).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tell others about your funding opportunity and get buy-in.&lt;/strong> If a stakeholder wants to take advantage of a funding opportunity, they should first tell others on the team about the opportunity and what they hope to do. This is the bare minimum - give others an opportunity to object to your plan and/or ask for clarifications or modifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make decisions before funding opportunities arise&lt;/strong>. If the community has already agreed that something is a good idea, then it is much simpler if funding simply helps &lt;em>implement&lt;/em> something rather than &lt;em>propose&lt;/em> something new.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="transparency--make-it-easy-for-others-to-see-your-interests-and-operations">
Transparency: make it easy for others to see your interests and operations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#transparency--make-it-easy-for-others-to-see-your-interests-and-operations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Most open projects are community-led, while funding tends to be awarded to one or more stakeholders &lt;em>within&lt;/em> that community. At a minimum, communities should ask stakeholders to provide transparency about why they&amp;rsquo;re looking for funding, what they&amp;rsquo;re agreeing to do, and how they spend the money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transparency is a way of building trust with other stakeholders by being clear about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to. It makes it easier for others to hold you accountable, and makes it easier for others to understand whether your actions are in line with the goals and values of the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Share your budget with the community&lt;/strong>. Money is always a sensitive subject, but communities have a right to know if funding is being spent towards roles and operations that align with their interests. Some communities may also have policies about how much funding can be awarded to an individual person, and making this clear (even if it is in aggregate) helps others understand what you&amp;rsquo;re doing with funds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Declare conflicts of interest&lt;/strong>. We all have multiple hats when working with an open source project (unless we&amp;rsquo;re paid full-time by the project itself). Any participating organization has their own mission, strategy, and interests. Some of these may be aligned with a community, and some may be aligned with a funding opportunity. It&amp;rsquo;s important to declare how these interests align and where they differ, especially as it pertains to power dynamics and how funding is used.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Carry out project planning and execution in public&lt;/strong>. Dedicated staff have more time than normal to decide and act quickly. If they don&amp;rsquo;t leave a paper trail for their work, it becomes difficult for those with less time to remain engaged and follow along. Make sure that you make your intentions, and the results of your actions, easily discoverable by those who do not have the same amount of time as you do to engage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="accountability-allow-others-to-decide-if-youve-done-a-good-job">
Accountability: allow others to decide if you&amp;rsquo;ve done a good job
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#accountability-allow-others-to-decide-if-youve-done-a-good-job">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Accountability is a complement to transparency - you need to show others what you&amp;rsquo;re up to, and let them tell you if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a good job. At a minimum this should happen at the level of the specific funding opportunity, but ideally you should give key community members visibility and agency into your organization&amp;rsquo;s broader strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ask for feedback about your strategic plan and how this funding fits into it&lt;/strong>. Tell a community about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to, and why you think this funding is in both of your interests to receive. Let them know how it fits in with the big picture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Give strategic oversight to community members that work for a different stakeholder&lt;/strong>. Give special attention to at least one community member that does not work for the same organization (for example, by creating an advisory board and briefing them on your progress and planning). This will help a more neutral perspective represent the interests of the community and avoid potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Perform an audit of your work and share it with others&lt;/strong>. Do your best to objectively assess your own progress towards your goals, and whether you believe you&amp;rsquo;ve represented the community&amp;rsquo;s interests in working towards them. Other community members may not have the resources to do this on their own, and you should use your dedicated funding to perform this yourself (while understandably declaring a conflict of interest in assessing your own work).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="equity-share-resources-and-knowledge-with-others">
Equity: share resources and knowledge with others
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#equity-share-resources-and-knowledge-with-others">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Open communities are a vehicle for building collaborations that span countries, economic situations, and use-cases. They are powerful because of their diverse and multi-stakeholder nature. However, they also exist in a society that is deeply inequitable and that perpetuates centers of wealth and power. This means that most open communities will have a subset of stakeholders with connections and resources that are unavailable to others. To ensure that we follow the principles of open culture, it is crucial that we find ways to push against this inequitable system by sharing resources with one another wherever possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, getting funding often means &lt;em>centralizing the ability to act in a small subset of people&lt;/em>. This runs the risk that decision-making (see above) and organizational knowledge become centralized with those individuals. If you&amp;rsquo;re paid full-time to work on an open source project, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you will personally come to understand the codebase better than anybody else just because you have the time to learn it. This can turn into an anti-pattern where those with access to resources have an unfair power advantage in their perspective over the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, running open source projects requires work on &lt;em>both&lt;/em> the creating and the receiving end. You can pay somebody to write a bunch of code, but somebody else still has to review it, lead discussions, and ultimately decide to merge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Share funding with others.&lt;/strong> If your work is going to require reviews and input from others, find a way to compensate them for their time (if they wish). Prioritize sharing resources with orgs from historically marginalized or disadvantaged communities. When dedicated resources are available, use them for these kinds of groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prioritize documentation and knowledge sharing.&lt;/strong> It can be attractive to work on shiny new things, but it is &lt;em>crucial&lt;/em> that you put in the work to share knowledge with others in a community so that your funding doesn&amp;rsquo;t become a source of knowledge and power centralization. Document your planning and work, and use that funding to make extra efforts to share your experience with others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define practices for making changes that require at least two stakeholders&lt;/strong>. This helps ensure that those funded to work on open source cannot overpower others in the community just because of their dedicated time. It also encourages healthier collaboration and communication between stakeholders.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="inclusion-bring-others-along-with-you">
Inclusion: bring others along with you
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#inclusion-bring-others-along-with-you">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A differentiating aspect of open communities is the way in which they &lt;em>share power among stakeholders&lt;/em>. Funding is inherently tied to power, as it gives you the ability to pay people to do things. Moreover, a stakeholder that &lt;em>controls&lt;/em> funding also controls what it is used for. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to simply share funding with others in a project, &lt;em>if that funding comes with strings attached&lt;/em>. It is also important to share opportunities for funding with others, and to build coalitions of equals when pursuing new funding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collaborators should be given agency over what they want to do with funding. They should be part of grant planning, project planning, etc. They should be seen as co-leads in discussion and announcements. Obviously any funding opportunity will come with obligations, but the important thing is who gets to decide what the team commits to in the first place, and how they plan to accomplish their goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Invite others to participate in funding opportunities, especially if they need it&lt;/strong>. If you identify a funding opportunity, tell others about it. Invite them to collaborate with you on a proposal, or encourage them to write their own proposal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Treat other stakeholders as partners, not contractors&lt;/strong>. Treat collaborators as co-equals that have a say in leadership, strategy, and planning. Funding shouldn&amp;rsquo;t solely come in the form of &amp;ldquo;strings attached&amp;rdquo; and contract work. It should center others as collaborators and leads that bring their own ideas to the table.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Find ways to give power to those who historically do not have it&lt;/strong>. Consider the power dynamics of who applies for funding and actively invite participation from those that need it or that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have access to these resources on their own. If you have a personal connection, use it to bring others to the table. If you&amp;rsquo;re at a well-known organization, use it to boost the profile of others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-i-actually-implement-any-of-this">
How do I actually implement any of this?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-actually-implement-any-of-this">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The ideas in this post are principles and goals to strive for. They also touch on very complex subjects, and following them all perfectly is unrealistic given the state of most organizations. The point is not to define a specific roadmap of actions that must be followed, but to note a few major anti-patterns and ways to avoid them. Fundamentally, your goal should be to &lt;strong>build trust with a community&lt;/strong> and to &lt;strong>live up to the community&amp;rsquo;s mission and values&lt;/strong>. Do what you can, and be honest and open with others in your efforts. A little bit of transparency and effort goes a long way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for 2i2c, we hope to use the ideas in this post to define a strategy and set of policies for how to engage with directed funding for open source. We&amp;rsquo;ll share new ideas in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>

This is a brief reflection on this experience, and an attempt to identify our opportunities for impact and growth in 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-major-goals-in-2022">
Our major goals in 2022

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We wrapped up 2021 with two major new changes.
We had just finished

&lt;p>Our biggest challenge in 2022 was to &lt;strong>identify the bottlenecks in this service model&lt;/strong>, and to begin &lt;strong>building the infrastructure to operate and scale it&lt;/strong>.
This included team infrastructure, technical infrastructure, and administrative infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we did to accomplish this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights-from-2022">
Highlights from 2022
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#highlights-from-2022">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In 2022, we &lt;strong>thoughtfully grew the number of communities we worked with&lt;/strong>, and used this to make iterative improvements in our model.
As a result, we learned some important things and made significant improvements to our service model and infrastructure.
Here are a few highlights.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-grew-the-number-of-our-partner-communities">
We grew the number of our partner communities
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-grew-the-number-of-our-partner-communities">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>As noted above, we needed to grow the number and diversity of communities we worked with to understand where our model needed to change.
At the end of 2022, we now have &lt;strong>43 community partner hubs across 17 clusters&lt;/strong> (and at least one on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud).
This amounts to roughly &lt;strong>~2,500 active users&lt;/strong> each week.
We also ran more dedicated infrastructure for more than &lt;strong>11 workshops and events&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-grew-our-revenue-from-community-partnerships">
We grew our revenue from community partnerships
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-grew-our-revenue-from-community-partnerships">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One of our goals is to reach self-sustainability without requiring grant funding for most of the communities we serve.
In 2022 we built administrative infrastructure to more efficiently recover monthly costs, and were able to bring in funding for our team from community partnerships.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a plot of our monthly non-grant revenue over the last several months:&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-got-grant-funding-to-serve-communities-in-latin-america-and-africa">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We also learned that some partnerships may &lt;em>require&lt;/em> subsidization from a third party, such as historically marginalized communities and those without dedicated resources.
To explore sustainable ways to serve these communities, we applied for and received a new grant to serve communities in Latin America and Africa!

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our ability to sustainably grow our service requires being able to &lt;em>technically&lt;/em> serve many communities from a relatively small team.
We centralized and standardized configuration and operations of many community hubs in one transparent space for all of our partner communities.
This allowed us to more easily grow the number of communities we served from one repository.

The Shared Responsibility Model provides a framework for assigning responsibility for various tasks with our partner communities.

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Cloud infrastructure inevitably degrades over time, and running ongoing services is largely about quickly responding to issues and resolving them quickly.
To do so, we need clear processes to follow in order to quickly identify and respond to major incidents in the infrastructure.
Our Incident Response process defines formal team roles and alerting mechanisms that are served by
&lt;a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PagerDuty&lt;/a>, following best-practices in industry.
This will make our service more reliable and make our processes more transparent for our partner communities.

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We recognized that many communities need more than just infrastructure running in the cloud - they will also benefit from usecase and community guidance.
We&amp;rsquo;re exploring a new range of roles that we could fill, starting with hiring a new team member to help us lead these efforts.

We refined our organizational strategy
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-refined-our-organizational-strategy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, the experience from this year gave us a lot to think about regarding our role and potential for impact in the research and education ecosystem and the open source community.
We
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/strategic-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >updated our strategy&lt;/a> in order to focus on a more holistic and collaborative approach to the work with our partner communities.
We&amp;rsquo;ll continue to refine this strategy moving forward.&lt;/p>

Things to accomplish in 2023
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#things-to-accomplish-in-2023">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re excited about all of the progress we made in 2022, and to continue that progress in 2023.
Here are a few areas where we wish to focus our efforts as we begin the new year to keep this momentum going.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sharpen-our-shared-responsibility-model">
Sharpen our Shared Responsibility Model
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#sharpen-our-shared-responsibility-model">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our Shared Responsibility Model is in a kind of &amp;ldquo;alpha&amp;rdquo; phase right now. We have some of the high-level skeleton there, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of detail to fill in. Thus far, communities have really liked the idea but we need to make it clearer how we break-down specific jobs and how to decide when to give more or less responsibility to another community.
We&amp;rsquo;d also like to define more intersection points with our partner communities at the level of strategic and service planning so that our communities have a say in our vision and strategic plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="grow-our-community-support-operations">
Grow our community support operations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#grow-our-community-support-operations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun exploring how to support communities in their &lt;em>usage&lt;/em> of cloud infrastructure, but still have a long way to go to understand what role we should play here.
For example, how can we assist communities in cloud workflows without becoming domain experts ourselves?
How can we guide communities in a sustainable and scalable way?
How can we recover the costs of doing this work?
We hope to use our experiences in
&lt;a href="" >our upcoming project to serve communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/a> to explore these questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="define-a-cost-recovery-model-that-balances-sustainability-and-accessibility">
Define a cost recovery model that balances sustainability and accessibility
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#define-a-cost-recovery-model-that-balances-sustainability-and-accessibility">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our current cost recovery model is intentionally very simple - we charge a fixed monthly cost for human time, and pass-through cloud costs directly.
We charge a bit more for more complex deployments and use-cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that this is both too expensive for simple deployments, and too cheap for really complex deployments.
It&amp;rsquo;s also inaccessible to organizations that do not have the resources to pay, which correlates heavily with historically marginalized communities.
We&amp;rsquo;ll need to refine this model to be both scalable and sustainable, but also accessible to the variety of communities we want to serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="incorporate-a-dedicated-software-development-practice-that-aligns-with-open-values">
Incorporate a dedicated software development practice that aligns with open values
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#incorporate-a-dedicated-software-development-practice-that-aligns-with-open-values">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In 2022 we learned that our position in &lt;em>running&lt;/em> infrastructure in the cloud gives us visibility into the ways that researchers and educators want open source tools to be &lt;em>improved&lt;/em>.
In some cases our partner organizations are also willing to contribute resources to help make this happen, or we can identify third parties to fund development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus far we have focused our efforts on &lt;em>deploying and managing&lt;/em> cloud infrastructure.
We do make improvements to software as a part of this, but there&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between running a cloud service and making significant &lt;em>enhancements&lt;/em> to software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to use our position to help funnel more resources into open source development, but there are a few tricky things to figure out.
For example: How can we accept funding to do open source work in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t effectively make us sole decision-makers or gatekeepers for doing development? How can we incorporate software development team practices into a team that has thus-far focused on operating cloud infrastructure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading this update about our work in 2022.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited about what we&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished thus far, as well how we hope to expand our impact in the near future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our goal is to create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service that enables community-based cloud-native workflows in the biosciences. We will promote values of open and inclusive community practices, infrastructure that enables these practices, and a “train the trainers” approach that empowers community leaders to share expertise in cloud infrastructure with others in their communities. Our focus will be on communities in Latin America and Africa, and we hope to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities that are historically marginalized from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will be providing cloud infrastructure operation and support for the communities that we partner with in this effort.
We will also assist with creating content to teach cloud-native workflows and assist community leaders in learning this content so that they can share these skills with others.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="introduction">
Introduction
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Mybinder.org&lt;/a> enables researchers across the world to replicate computational environments in the cloud. It allows researchers to turn static code into interactive literate coding environments with a click of a button within seconds. The
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> service is powered by
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a>, an open-source tool developed by
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Jupyter Project&lt;/a> that many organizations have deployed for their own communities. It does this by _dynamically building _the software environment needed to reproduce a computation (using a tool called
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>), and making this environment available to users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BinderHub was developed for use-cases that are &lt;em>temporary&lt;/em> and &lt;em>fully open&lt;/em> by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past several years, the
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GESIS Notebooks&lt;/a> team made the first steps towards bridging this gap through their
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Persistent BinderHub&lt;/a> implementation. This was a modified and authenticated BinderHub that &lt;em>included&lt;/em> persistent storage across sessions. The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NFDI4DS&lt;/a> (GAN: 460234259),
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CESSDA&lt;/a>, and members of the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JMTE&lt;/a> project. This collaboration has three primary goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generalize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure&lt;/strong>, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects&lt;/strong>, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub&lt;/strong>, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See
&lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this GitHub Projects Board for issues that implement this effort&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">
Exploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the
&lt;a href="http://binderhub.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>. We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Persistent BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>. The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >modified Helm Chart&lt;/a> that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality &lt;em>natively&lt;/em> into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to take another approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">
Exploration 2: Add dynamic image building to JupyterHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, &lt;strong>we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using
&lt;a href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a> project that
&lt;a href="https://quantstack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QuantStack&lt;/a> had built for the
&lt;a href="https://plasmabio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PlasmaBio project&lt;/a>. This implementation was seen as successful, and something others in the community had wanted to generalize for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="our-implementation-plan">
Our implementation plan
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-implementation-plan">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="two-phases-of-implementation">
Two phases of implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#two-phases-of-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a back-end for dynamic environment building&lt;/strong>. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and is easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are a few tasks that we’re carrying out next to make progress on the above two items.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a working prototype for image generation via a &lt;em>JupyterHub Service&lt;/em> (see below for current status)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research the &lt;code>tljh-repo2docker&lt;/code> code base to understand how we could build upon its UX and functionality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the typical process that GESIS and NFDI users follow in their BinderHub workflows, to ensure that it can be replicated via this new implementation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform UI/UX research validation to inform the implementation from a user’s perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a follow-up, we’ll likely re-work the BinderHub codebase to utilize JupyterHub’s new repo2docker service, rather than defining its own custom repo2docker functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">
Back-end implementation as a JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We’re planning to use
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Services&lt;/a> to add the back-end functionality for dynamic image building to a JupyterHub. Services are a way to expose functionality via a JupyterHub REST API, and would allow us to expose basic image generation on-the-fly with
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>. We aim for basic functionality to be as close as possible to repo2docker’s default behavior, but to make this functionality _composable and customizable _if a JupyterHub administrator wants to provide different out-of-the-box functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While details may still change, we believe that the major architectural plan has now been settled. We have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an experimental codebase&lt;/a> with a basic implementation of the repo2docker service described above. As part of this effort, this team has also made a number of improvements to repo2docker’s codebase and project infrastructure. We hope that this effort will continue to push resources and attention to repo2docker by growing the number of users and stakeholders that rely on the project for their success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">
Front-end implementation that uses this service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once the back-end setup exists, we can use it to begin prototyping user interactions that can trigger and use repo2docker’s image generation. Bringing dynamic environment image building into JupyterHub is a significant improvement in its functionality, and may introduce new kinds of workflows that we hadn’t initially imagined. Understanding, interpreting, and extending the original “Persistent BinderHub” workflow will require a more thorough understanding of user stories and needs in order to identify new workflows that feel natural not only in a JupyterHub scenario but also in a Binder-like scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here are a few major UI/UX questions we must answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When a user builds an image, should it also become available to &lt;em>other users&lt;/em> as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can a user store, find, and delete old images that they’ve built?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about new versions of the same image?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should we simply mimic the mybinder.org UX, or should this be improved as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We must answer these and several other questions next. With that vision in place, we’d like to &lt;strong>expand our efforts in UI/UX and user research&lt;/strong>. This will help inform the technical implementation of this work as we expand on our prototype, and help us choose the right way to expose this functionality to users. We welcome collaboration around this work - if you know of an organization that is interested in collaboration, please reach out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a few months working on this project, we are even more excited about the potential for dynamically building environments in a JupyterHub. We believe that it adds a new class of workflows to JupyterHubs that were not possible before, and will be immediately useful to the hundreds of communities that deploy JupyterHub for their communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The why, what, and how of our NASA Openscapes cloud infrastructure: 2i2c JupyterHub and corn environment</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/external-openscapes-corn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/external-openscapes-corn/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Grant progress report: CZI Foundational grant year 2</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>We recently completed a progress report for Year 2 of our primary CZI funding grant.

Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We made a number of improvements to our cloud infrastructure and the processes around our service.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief breakdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We expanded our shared clusters to new cloud providers and regions&lt;/strong>. We now have shared clusters already deployed on Google Cloud Platform on &lt;code>us-central1-b&lt;/code> and &lt;code>europe-west2&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We defined an incident commander process&lt;/strong>. This will allow us to coordinate and respond to major outages in our cloud infrastructure more efficiently. See
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/projects/managed-hubs/incidents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our incident response documentation&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We improved our cloud usage monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a centralized Grafana Dashboard&lt;/a> that aggregates cloud usage across all of our partner communities, and allows us to keep track of any unexpected behavior or outages across them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-were-focusing-next">
Where we&amp;rsquo;re focusing next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#where-were-focusing-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the final quarter of this year, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus our efforts on &lt;strong>growing capacity&lt;/strong> across all of the aspects of our team.
Now that we have brought on several more partner communities into our Managed JupyterHub Service, it has shown us where we have bottlenecks in our technology, process, and structure.
In 2023 we hope to significantly grow the number of communities we work with, and so we must grow our capacity to be able to take on these new partnerships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aim to accomplish this in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make technical improvements&lt;/strong> to our cloud infrastructure that reduces the amount of human labor associated with regular actions. This will make our cloud infrastructure more scalable and reliable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and partnership leads pipeline&lt;/strong> so that we can reduce the amount of administrative toil for ourselves and for the communities we work with in billing and cloud cost pass-through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Refine our organizational strategy and structure&lt;/strong> so that we are better-able to agree on our most important objectives, and to execute on them efficiently as a distributed team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hire people!&lt;/strong> While improving our efficiency will certainly grow our capacity, we also hope to grow our capacity the old fashioned way: by hiring more team members. We&amp;rsquo;re identifying the biggest needs on our team now and will hope to have postings soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="thanks">

It is a brainstorm from the Executive Director, shared as a blog post to invite feedback and provide transparency into our current thinking. Its goal is to explore the context of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s stakeholders and their needs, and identify an opportunity and plan for having a positive impact with these communities. It is not a concrete proposal but a snapshot of thinking in time meant to trigger reflection. Over time we will incorporate some of these ideas
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >into our Team Compass&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we founded 2i2c, we largely did so from the &amp;ldquo;bottom up&amp;rdquo; - we identified several patterns around hosted infrastructure that were useful at
&lt;a href="https://datahub.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >UC Berkeley&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a>, and similar communities, and we wished to make them more generalized, accessible, and scalable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We defined our mission as the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Our mission is to make research and education more impactful, accessible, and delightful by developing, operating, and supporting infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And a description about our immediate activities to make things a bit more concrete:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>2i2c designs, develops, and operates JupyterHubs in the cloud for communities of practice in research &amp;amp; education. It builds and supports open source infrastructure that serves these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Around a year ago
&lt;a href="http://2i2c.org/blog/2021/six-month-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >we began our pilot JupyterHubs project&lt;/a> to learn more about our biggest challenges and opportunities in making interactive computing more accessible and useful for research and education.
While both of these statements are still accurate, over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned more about the value that 2i2c provides. This post is an exploration of how these statements and our strategy may evolve in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-did-we-miss-with-our-original-strategy">
What did we miss with our original strategy?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-did-we-miss-with-our-original-strategy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In short: it is too-focused on &lt;strong>actions&lt;/strong> rather than &lt;strong>impact&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While running JupyterHubs is a key part of what 2i2c does, it is a means to an end rather than our end-goal.
Infrastructure is only useful if it changes workflows in a way that aligns with the goals and values that we wish to achieve.
We&amp;rsquo;ve historically defined these in a few scattered places. For example, here are the values listed on our website:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2i2c values fairness and justice as requirements for successful communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2i2c values learning and discovery for all people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2i2c values collaborating and connecting to foster environments for learning and discovery.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>However, it is difficult to tie our operations directly to values and goals without making them concrete, and without defining a plan that ties them to our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through our JupyterHubs pilot, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned how our actions-focused approach was missing some important aspects of these broader goals.
For example, we came to understand that a big part of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s value isn&amp;rsquo;t just providing a JupyterHub, it is &lt;em>de-risking cloud native workflows&lt;/em> for communities that are inherently skeptical of what cloud infrastructure offers.
Doing this entails many things: teaching, making decisions on behalf of others, supporting and answering questions, building trust, and yes, managing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="refining-our-strategy">
Refining our strategy
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#refining-our-strategy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>With this in mind, we&amp;rsquo;d like to &lt;strong>make our strategy more clearly-defined and tied to our operational choices&lt;/strong>. Here are a few ways we&amp;rsquo;d like to do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Define our organization&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>values and vision&lt;/strong> for the impact we wish to have.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define the key &lt;strong>stakeholder communities&lt;/strong> that we wish to serve, the context of tools and services that are relevant to these stakeholders, and the assumptions we&amp;rsquo;re making.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define the &lt;strong>problems these stakeholders have&lt;/strong>, the ways in which their current workflow could be improved, and the opportunity to help them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Describe our &lt;strong>strategy&lt;/strong> to positively impact these stakeholders with our work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define a collection of &lt;strong>goals and objectives&lt;/strong> to carry out this strategy in the near-term.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The rest of this post will take a crack at answering a few of these questions. It is intentionally messy, and meant both as a public snapshot of my thinking at this moment, and fodder for discussion and more specific proposals in the future.&lt;/p>

Context: Our key stakeholders and the impact we wish to have
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#context-our-key-stakeholders-and-the-impact-we-wish-to-have">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s key stakeholders are communities of practice that are dedicated to creating and sharing public knowledge.
These are primarily made up of &lt;strong>researchers&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>educators&lt;/strong> in the global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For these stakeholders, we wish to catalyze and support a transformation in their data workflows that allows them to be more collaborative, inclusive, efficient, and powerful in the impact they wish to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="assumptions-we-make-about-our-stakeholders">
Assumptions we make about our stakeholders
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#assumptions-we-make-about-our-stakeholders">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There are a few unique things about these communities that are important for us:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Researchers and educators see their job as &lt;strong>creating and sharing knowledge with a heterogeneous and global community&lt;/strong>. They can&amp;rsquo;t make many assumptions about the organizational context or resources of this community, or their work will become inaccessible to others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They &lt;strong>work at vertically-oriented institutions&lt;/strong> (e.g., a university with an in-house IT department), but their communities are &lt;strong>organized horizontally across institutions&lt;/strong> (a researcher may identify more with colleagues in their field than with their co-workers at the university).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a result, these communities &lt;strong>value workflows that are maximally accessible, portable, modular, simple, and long-lasting&lt;/strong>. This allows them to define a shared set of practices across their institutional boundaries without requiring a lot of vertical decision-making.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Historically, this means that scientists must choose between workflows that are underpowered but accessible (e.g., collapsed into a PDF describing the work), or powerful but inaccessible to many (e.g., they rely on extensive training or resources only accessible to some institutions).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-source-tools-have-boosted-standardization-and-collaboration-across-communities">
Open source tools have boosted standardization and collaboration across communities
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-tools-have-boosted-standardization-and-collaboration-across-communities">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over the past ten years, the proliferation of open source tools has vastly expanded our potential to create public knowledge in a more accessible, modular, inclusive, and productive way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, core numerical computing infrastructure like
&lt;a href="https://numpy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NumPy&lt;/a> provides a foundation for more domain specific numerical libraries to build on. Tools like
&lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pandas&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://xarray.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >XArray&lt;/a> allow for more sophisticated data structures that match the complex and heterogeneous data in the research community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has led to many domain-specific communities of practice building upon the same APIs and infrastructure to solve their specific needs. By largely sharing the same stack, we have reduced duplication of effort and make it easier to speak the same language across data-rich fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="but-a-local-workflow-with-open-source-tools-is-inaccessible-or-underpowered-for-many-people">
&amp;hellip;but a local workflow with open source tools is inaccessible or underpowered for many people
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#but-a-local-workflow-with-open-source-tools-is-inaccessible-or-underpowered-for-many-people">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>However, this has also led to a few key problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 1: The ecosystem of open source tools is huge and complex, and hard to tailor for specific domain workflows&lt;/strong>. It is hard to decide which tools to use for a workflow, and we do not have efficient community processes for creating and standardizing workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 2: For many users, it is still too difficult to set up a local environment&lt;/strong>. Installing the right libraries and their dependencies is complex and domain-specific. This leads to wasted time and confusion, especially for newcomers or learners in an educational context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, there is another workflow-related problem that arises even when you do set up a proper environment:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 3: Local workflows are not scalable enough for many communities&lt;/strong>. Working with 10GB of data can be challenging in a local context, working with 10TB of data quickly becomes impossible. This leads to communities that &amp;ldquo;share data&amp;rdquo; by making lots of local copies that are distributed to individual users. This harms data provenance and makes our work less reproducible and accessible. It limits the scope of questions we can ask with data and increases the friction for sharing our work with others. As our workflows require more computation and data, a &amp;ldquo;local, fixed hardware&amp;rdquo; approach will become more and more underpowered.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managed-cloud-services-can-solve-the-accessibility-problem-for-many-workflows-and-tools">
Managed cloud services can solve the accessibility problem for many workflows and tools
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-cloud-services-can-solve-the-accessibility-problem-for-many-workflows-and-tools">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One way to resolve these problems is to rely on &lt;strong>managed infrastructure services&lt;/strong> to provide the environments needed for data analysis. A systems administrator can set up computing and data resources, and then expose these resources to many users as a service. This makes these complex and powerful environments more accessible, standardizes the workflows of users to make it easier for them to collaborate, and potentially serves as a gateway to more complex data and computing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, this work was done in-house by internal teams at research institutions. This led to many unique infrastructure setups with slight differences across institutions. It also led to data and workflows being institution-centric, even though many communities are organized &lt;em>across&lt;/em> institutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure can solve this problem&lt;/strong>. It provides a layer of infrastructure that can be used to standardize access and worfklows across communities of practice. It can be more accessible than on-prem infrastructure, as the cloud is already globally distributed in a way that local hardware can never be. Moreover, cloud infrastructure is also much more scalable, and can be used to access more sophisticated data and computing resources in a fluid manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="but-the-cloud-services-landscape-is-not-designed-for-research-and-education-communities">
But the cloud services landscape is not designed for research and education communities
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#but-the-cloud-services-landscape-is-not-designed-for-research-and-education-communities">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over the last 10 years, a huge ecosystem of cloud-native tools and services have grown to solve this problem in industry. These are often called the
&lt;a href="https://future.com/emerging-architectures-modern-data-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Modern Data Stack&lt;/a>. However, &lt;strong>modern cloud services are largely unused by research and education&lt;/strong>. Why is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe it is because most cloud services do not meet many needs of research and educational communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They tend to be offered by a single vendor, which results in a fear of lock-in or vendor-specific workflows that result in high-costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They require users to learn non-standard workflows that are attached to the cloud service.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They often require extensive knowledge of data and cloud resources to configure properly. They may require an internal dev-ops team to integrate cloud services and expose them for internal teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are often still institution-centric because cloud services are geared towards enterprise contracts within vertically-integrated organizations. Many research organizations are more like collections of little fiefdoms rather than a single kingdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In short, &lt;strong>many cloud services ask researchers and educators to give up too much agency and choice, and make them reliant on organizations they do not inherently trust&lt;/strong>. They are perceived as a risky alternative to the &amp;ldquo;we have control and have visibility into everything&amp;rdquo; nature of on-prem hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="examples-of-a-potential-model-for-community-centric-cloud-services">
Examples of a potential model for community-centric cloud services
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#examples-of-a-potential-model-for-community-centric-cloud-services">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over the past several years we have seen several communities strike a balance that made cloud infrastructure more accessible while still retaining agency for the communities of practice that used and managed the infrastructure.
For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Pangeo Project&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cloud-native geospatial analytics platform&lt;/a> that builds on the Dask, Zarr, and XArray stack to enable distributed and collaborative access to large-scale geospatial datasets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cloud-native educational community&lt;/a> that uses a managed service to provide interactive learning environments to thousands of students via the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Syzygy service&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >federated network of educational hubs&lt;/a> that run entirely on open source infrastructure in the cloud, managed for universities in Canada.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each of these communities roughly followed the same model:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integrate&lt;/strong> a collection of open source tools and cloud services into a standardized cloud environment for a community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Customize&lt;/strong> the environment and cloud resources via open source tools that provide remote interactive computing sessions. This is usually done with
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Contribute&lt;/strong> to upstream tools and redeploy improvements to a community&amp;rsquo;s shared infrastucture in order to enhance the service.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Moreover, they use nearly identical technical stacks: some combination of Jupyter infrastructure to manage cloud infrastructure and provide interactive computing environments, a Scientific Python or R-based stack for the libraries users access, and a collection of online services to facilitate collaboration and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These services required a combination of &lt;strong>dev-ops and cloud engineering&lt;/strong> skills to integrate the tools and manage the infrastructure, as well as &lt;strong>community guidance and teaching&lt;/strong> to standardize and share workflows across a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why couldn&amp;rsquo;t this model just be repeated across many other communities as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="however-running-your-own-cloud-infrastructure-is-a-lot-of-work">
However, running your own cloud infrastructure is a lot of work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#however-running-your-own-cloud-infrastructure-is-a-lot-of-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>These initiatives demonstrate the potential of building community-centric cloud services on top of open source tools, but they were also unscalable to other communities. Observing these success stories also reveals a few more problems that we must resolve in order to make these services more generalizable and accessible to new communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 4: Running your own cloud requires skills and resources that most organizations do not have&lt;/strong>. In order to make the most of the cloud and to provide it as a resource reliable-enough for important workflows, it is important to have a knowledgeable team with best-practices in distributed cloud management. However, hiring engineers in this space is very difficult, and the team structure and culture needed for these services is often at-odds with the way universities are structured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 5: Contributing to open source communities requires dedicated time and skills&lt;/strong>. When building services on top of open source tools, you will invariably need to improve the tools in order to fix bugs or to enhance your service. Doing this is very different from a contract with a traditional vendor, and requires building skills in how to communicate and interact with open source communities. For key open source infrastructure, it also requires an ongoing investment of time into upstream community work that is hard for many institutions to justify.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 6: When institutions run their own clouds, they tend to re-invent institution-centric anti-patterns.&lt;/strong> For example, an institution might expose a cloud-based service but make it available only to individuals with an institutional account.
They might staff it with an under-resourced team (or just a single person). They might make small decisions that differ from institution to institution. All of this limits the effectiveness of the cloud for facilitating collaboration and sharing within communities of practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, while vendor-specific cloud services often come with a lot of training material, self-managed cloud services require institutions to build their own practices and guidance for how to use the infrastructure. This results in another major problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 7: Communities need assistance in understanding what is possible with cloud-native workflows, and adapting these workflows to their domains.&lt;/strong> There is enormous value in integrating tools together and exposing them as a highly-accessible managed service via the cloud. However, most communities of practice are still new to cloud-native workflows, and they need considerable guidance to begin sharing their practices within a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are several major problems that we must overcome in order to make cloud infrastructure more accessible and useful to research and education communities while living up to our values of community agency and open workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-opportunity-for-impact">
Our opportunity for impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-opportunity-for-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>To summarize, we believe that there is the following opportunity for impact:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make communities in research and education do work that is more collaborative, reproducible, and impactful&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a way that gives them agency and flexibility to do their work as they wish&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By integrating open tools and standards, managing them as a service with scalable cloud infrastructure, and guiding communities in deciding how to use these tools for their domain-specific problems&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We believe that the best way to do this is via a mission-aligned non-profit service that is based on values of trust, shared responsibility, and transparency. This will allow us to treat our relationships with communities as &lt;strong>collaborators, not customers&lt;/strong> and share responsibility and agency with them. In this way we can act as a vehicle for &lt;strong>sharing resources and ideas across communities&lt;/strong> via our infrastructure and services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can make such a service both &lt;strong>sustainable&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>scalable&lt;/strong> because we are delivering direct value to communities with resources. There are many
&lt;a href="https://www.ffwd.org/playbook/choose-a-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >potential business models&lt;/a> that are already in existence (for example, &lt;em>Software as a Service&lt;/em> or shared research infrastructure services like supercomputing centers). By generating resources in exchange for these services, we can &lt;strong>centralize cloud infrastructure services for many communities into a single, scalable team&lt;/strong>. By committing ourselves to an &lt;em>upstream-first service model&lt;/em>, we can &lt;strong>drive resources towards open source communities&lt;/strong> and make these tools more useful for our key stakeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A model like this naturally sets up a two-directional virtuous cycle where open source communities and public knowledge communities derive value from one another&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p>

How should 2i2c try to achieve this impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-should-2i2c-try-to-achieve-this-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>With this in mind, we hope to focus our organizational efforts around building services that focus on the following actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integrate&lt;/strong> open source tools and services into a cloud-native service that is optimized for scientific workflows and communities. The end-product should not feel like &amp;ldquo;a 2i2c product&amp;rdquo; but a service anybody with enough skills could build themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manage&lt;/strong> cloud infrastructure with an &amp;ldquo;upstream first&amp;rdquo; mentality to provide a high-quality and accessible service for global communities. This will allow communities to focus on their work instead of the infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support&lt;/strong> the communities that use this infrastructure so that questions and problems are dealt with quickly. This will de-risk the service (and the cloud more generally) with the knowledge that help is available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guide&lt;/strong> communities in using these tools to do their work more effectively and collaboratively. This will speed up the learning and sharing process so that communities are able to make the most of the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collaborate&lt;/strong> with these communities and embody the values we want to see in the research community to build trust and lead others. This will build trust and strengthen relationships between our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Over time, we may add new verbs (such as &lt;strong>develop&lt;/strong> open source software and &lt;strong>lead&lt;/strong> open source communities), but the ones above define our initial organizational focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-most-important-actions-to-take">
Our most important actions to take
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-most-important-actions-to-take">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Accomplishing this requires blending aspects of cloud infrastructure management, domain and workflow expertise, and collaborative service design. As we move forward, these are the biggest challenges to overcome in developing this service further:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a top-notch global Site Reliability Engineering Team&lt;/strong>. First and foremost, the infrastructure that we manage must be reliable and scalable. If you ask communities to do their work in the cloud, they must be confident that it will be stable and highly available. If you wish to serve a global community, then you must build systems management capacity on a global level. This means investing heavily in our asynchronous coordination and communication processes, and building team skills in the modern cloud infrastructure stack and dev-ops practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build centralized cloud deployment infrastructure for community-first services&lt;/strong>. We need the ability to centrally manage infrastructure that is delivered in a community-specific manner to many different communities of practice. This will allow us to achieve economies of scale in managing and running the infrastructure, while allowing communities to have agency over their tools to customize them for their needs. To do this we&amp;rsquo;ll need to use open source tools and cloud services that are designed for flexibility and modularity, create out-of-the-box infrastructure that gets communities 80% of the way there, and gives them the power to define the last 20% in a way that is sustainable for both them and our team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define two or three scientific workflows to focus on, and integrate the right tools and services into a distribution for each&lt;/strong>. We must identify a few scientific workflows to focus on, as well as the infrastructure stack that will be most-useful to the communities that require these workflows. We must integrate this infrastructure into a distribution that any community could pick up, but that has enough flexibility for each to solve their &amp;ldquo;last-mile problem&amp;rdquo; with customizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define a support and guidance model for community-first services&lt;/strong>. Our support and guidance similarly needs to be generic enough to be scalable to many kinds of communities, but with the ability for communities to make their own customizations and have agency over their training and content. In this way we can be a centralized resource that communities can use to grow their own practice of cloud-native workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify a collaborative service delivery model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t create too much overhead&lt;/strong>. We believe that community-centric infrastructure should be transparent and participatory, and provide agency to communities in shaping their service. On the other hand, we wish to serve many different communities, and thus we must minimize the amount of labor associated with serving any particular community. As a result we must build a collaborative model of roles and expectations around our services that balances participation from community representatives against our ability to act quickly to ensure the best service possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify a cost-recovery model that is globally accessible and scalable&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve a large and global collection of communities with our services, and so we must identify a way to recover our costs such that we are not restricted to serving only the wealthiest communities in the world, and such that &amp;ldquo;cost vs. resources generated&amp;rdquo; gives us the flexibility to grow to serve a large global community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an upstream-first culture&lt;/strong>. If we wish to leverage open source tools in our work, we need to build team expertise in interacting with open source communities, deploying their technology in our services, and making improvements to our service by upstream contributions to open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an organizational culture that embodies the values we want to support&lt;/strong>. In order to build a better, more collaborative, more inclusive network of communities of practice, we need to embody the principles we wish to help grow in other communities. This will help us build trust with organizations that are inherently skeptical of &amp;ldquo;outsourcing&amp;rdquo; responsibilities to other organizations, and will make us more effective advocates for the same kinds of practices in other communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There are many other issues we must tackle, but we&amp;rsquo;ve identified these as being crucial to 2i2c accomplishing its mission. Over the coming months we will continue to refine our practices and service model. As we learn more, we&amp;rsquo;ll update our understanding of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s situation and potential for impact, and our strategy for accomplishing our mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this framing helps others understand our position relative to the communities we wish to serve, and the impact we wish to have. We welcome any feedback or suggestions about how we can refine these ideas to better-serve our communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="appendix-future-growth">
Appendix: Future growth
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#appendix-future-growth">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Many people also ask what the growth model looks like for 2i2c.
Our pricing strategy above should include our goal of &lt;strong>building a financial buffer&lt;/strong> in order to boost the financial resiliency of the organization, and to provide us room to grow if there is an opportunity to expand our service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we want to focus our efforts on the strategic goals described above, here is how I think 2i2c could grow its operations and expand its impact as a next step.
These are initiatives for which we might seek grant funding to experiment with sustainable and scalable models.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create a software development team&lt;/strong>. Right now our technical efforts are focused on &lt;em>integrating&lt;/em> pre-existing tools and services, and &lt;em>managing&lt;/em> these services in the cloud. However there are many opportunities to &lt;em>create&lt;/em> and &lt;em>enhance&lt;/em> the ecosystem of tools that is out there. Doing dedicated software development is very different from Site Reliability Engineering, and we will need to build our financial and staffing capacity to dedicate team members to this work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Expand the kinds of cloud services we offer&lt;/strong>. Currently we focus our efforts around providing &lt;em>research and analysis platforms&lt;/em> in the cloud. These are often connected to other cloud resources (like datasets) but we do not manage them ourselves. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to strategically grow the services we provide - most notably in the area of cloud data management and migration. However, this is beyond our current capacity and we will need to grow more before moving in this direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an open source support operation&lt;/strong>. There are many things that open source communities need beyond technical improvements. Providing community, operational, and strategic support is another way that 2i2c could use its resources and experience to benefit open source communities that we work with. However, we need to better-understand how to do this in a way that is sustainable for us, and that respects open source communities as independent organizations with their own mission, strategy, and expectations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create a cloud infrastructure training operation&lt;/strong>. Many communities we work with &lt;em>aspire to run their own cloud infrastructure&lt;/em>. They wish to work with a trusted partner like 2i2c in the short-term, but in the long term they want to build their own capacity in running similar services. 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s cloud services are a unique opportunity for others to get hands-on training to grow their skills. Perhaps there is a way for us to share this experience with members from other communities in a way that they can then bring back with them to other organizations. There will be an inherent tension between this and our sustainability model from ongoing services, but we believe it is an important opportunity to explore since it aligns with our values of community agency and choice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Problem statement
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#problem-statement">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cloud infrastructure is a powerful way to broaden access to workflows and infrastructure across the globe.
However, it is also inaccessible to many for a variety of reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a large, diverse, and messy ecosystem of open source tools to facilitate cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most communities don&amp;rsquo;t already have skills in utilizing cloud workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Running infrastructure in the cloud takes dedicated time and expertise that many communities lack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many communities do not have organized communities of practice around cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These issues are true for most scientific communities, but they are exacerbated in countries that are often marginalized in the global scientific community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-proposed-work">
Our proposed work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-proposed-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For this reason, our goal in this grant is to &lt;strong>provide human and technical services to facilitate learning and knowledge transfer of cloud workflows for communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It defines four major areas of collaboration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure management&lt;/strong> - to facilitate access to cloud resources via managed cloud services that integrate open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Application guidance and training&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with the skills to utilize this infrastructure for their needs. This includes language-localized content and training materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Training for trainers&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to share these workflows with others in their communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Community leadership and management&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to sustain and grow healthy communities of practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If this proposal is funded, over the course of two years the team will provide a combination of the services described above for communities in Latin America and Africa, with the goal of understanding how such services can be most useful for these communities, how we can structure them to provide community representation in the direction of these services, and how we can sustain and scale this model of community-focused services for a global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Importantly, we wish to do this work in a way that centers the communities we work with as co-leaders and collaborators in these services.
We will explore ways to run these services and workshops so that they are transparent, inclusive, and give agency to the communities they support.
Ultimately, we hope that this can be an extensible model for many more communities in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/meetings/eddy-symposium-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >3rd Eddy Cross Disciplinary Symposium&lt;/a> held recently in Vail Colorado. The event was hosted by the Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (
&lt;a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CPAESS&lt;/a>) team at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (
&lt;a href="https://www.ucar.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >UCAR&lt;/a>) with support from NASA.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="context">
Context
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#context">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Symposium was framed by the interesting and interdisciplinary scientific career of the late
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Eddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jack Eddy&lt;/a>. Eddy&amp;rsquo;s legacy was highlighted and his influence has been extended by dynamic leadership from NASA Program Officer
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership/lead-program-scientist-for-lws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Madhulika Guhathakurta (Lika)&lt;/a>. Lika helped launch and has sustained NASA&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/programs/living-with-a-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Living with a Star (LWS)&lt;/a> program over the past two decades. Prior to LWS, NASA had a variety of siloed efforts focused on near-Sun and near-Earth behavior. The LWS program led to an integration of these efforts under &amp;ldquo;system science&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;systems engineering&amp;rdquo; approaches and an expressed desired to connect LWS research activities with impacts on Earth (society, biology, culture, etc.). The program has expanded to include explorations of similar questions arising around other planets in our solar system and the recently discovered collection of exoplanets. Scientists from diverse disciplines (plasma physics, stellar evolution, atmospheric chemistry, space weather, planetary science,&amp;hellip;) work together on &amp;ldquo;cross disciplinary&amp;rdquo; research that helps us understand our lives near our star.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Symposium focused on three disciplinary areas (&lt;strong>Exoplanets&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Sun-Climate and Star-Climate interactions&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Risk and resilience of space weather&lt;/strong>) unified under the cross-cutting thread of &lt;strong>open science&lt;/strong>. Frequent references were made to the upcoming 2023 Year of Open Science and
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA&amp;rsquo;s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission&lt;/a>. Symposium attendees listened to talks surveying the four areas in the morning and participated in hackathon-style breakout projects during the afternoons. Work on the projects launched at the Eddy Symposium
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >continues&lt;/a>. The space weather group is investigating ways to make the power grid more resilient. The Sun-climate group is exploring plans to establish an institute focused on Sun-climate interactions and improve connections between climate and heliophysics research communities. The exoplanets team is developing tools to programmatically compare Sun-Earth and star-exoplanet interactions.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c, with input from Symposium CoChair&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://staff.ucar.edu/users/marsh" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Dan Marsh&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="http://www.ryanmcgranaghan.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Ryan McGranaghan&lt;/a>, rapidly deployed a cloud-hosted JupyterHub for use during the event. The hub provided a shared space for participants to explore data, run analyses, and collaborate with one another using modern tools including Zarr, Xarray and Dask Gateway. Access to the interactive computing platform was granted to any member of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Symposium&amp;rsquo;s GitHub organization&lt;/a>. The work to set up that hub, openly chronicled in this GitHub issue (
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1329" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> 2i2c-org/infrastructure#1329&lt;/a> ), included swapping out a Pangeo-style software environment for a heliophysics-specific resource developed by
&lt;a href="http://heliocloud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >HelioCloud&lt;/a> with special thanks to
&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/bios/mwm/Thomas-Brian-bio.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Brian Thomas&lt;/a>!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c co-founder Fernando Pérez gave a talk on how he is
&lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i99eQqOVCSQyxoyscUo0dl3Ybgdex5qKo_KEO9YGxQg/edit?usp=drivesdk" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&amp;ldquo;living la vida nube&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a>. Fernando described the ways he, research collaborators, and students are using the Jupyter ecosystem. Diverse and curated tools in Jupyter hubs for the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Meets the Earth Project&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s data science programs&lt;/a> were highlighted. The talk showcased how these tools have been integrated to support individuals and communities of practice in data-driven research. In response to requests from the organizers and participants, Fernando gave a demonstration on how to use the hub 2i2c set up for the Symposium and an introduction to version control using &lt;code>git&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c co-founder Jim Colliander gave a talk titled
&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/eddy-science-commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Governing the Science Commons&lt;/a>. Three key points from Jim&amp;rsquo;s talk were: the virtue that should guide the improvements to the scientific enterprise is intellectual generosity; implementation of intellectual generosity into science requires commons-based governance; the convergence of open source tools that support data-intensive collaborative research and learning (as showcased by Fernando) and agency interest (
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA TOPS&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000379949/PDF/379949eng.pdf.multi.page=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >UNESCO&lt;/a>) in open science is an inflection point for global change. The talk ended with a call to action for the diverse communities represented at the Symposium to improve the ways we do science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="things-we-learned">
Things we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#things-we-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Our experience with the Symposium taught 2i2c a few things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned that our engineering team can rapidly deploy interactive computing resources to support a research and education community. Along the way, we confirmed what we&amp;rsquo;ve been learning from Pangeo and the neuroscience communities: flexible methods to customize the software environment are necessary. We confirmed that our developing
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/service/shared-responsibility.html?highlight=shared%20responsibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >shared responsibility model&lt;/a>, enabling domain-specific experts to provide curated toolchains for their communities while leveraging 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure expertise, is the right approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned that managing access to the hub using members in a GitHub organization works but involves some toil since organizers had to work through the GitHub invitation process for each participant. We are exploring others ways to systematically grant event participants access to a hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Eddy Symposium experience reminded us that some skill at using &lt;code>git&lt;/code> is vital for collaboration. Fernando&amp;rsquo;s brief introduction to &lt;code>git&lt;/code> provided
&lt;a href="https://jack-eddy-symposium.github.io/intro-git-jupyter/intro-git/git-visuals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the mental model of working on a directed acyclyic graph&lt;/a>. Roving support from Jim and Fernando during the afternoon hackathon sessions normalized the skill level across the groups but not without a few merge conflicts and frustration. Near the beginning of future workshops, we will follow an improved approach aimed at establishing good &lt;code>git&lt;/code> hygeine and familiarity with the collaboration workflow using a simple pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are honored to have had the opportunity to collaborate with the Eddy Symposium team by managing infrastructure and participating in the workshop. We learned a lot about how to support the Helio and adjacent communities, and are proud of the ways in which our infrastructure helped them do their work more openly and effectively. We hope to build on these successes with these and other communities in the future!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tech update: Multiple JupyterHubs, multiple clusters, one repository.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/ci-cd-improvements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/ci-cd-improvements/</guid><description>&lt;p>2i2c manages the configuration and deployment of multiple Kubernetes clusters and JupyterHubs from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a single open infrastructure repository&lt;/a>.
This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a short description of what we did and the benefit that it had.
It covers the technical details and provides links to more information about our deployment setup.
We hope that it helps other organizations make similar improvements to their own infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-problem">
Our problem
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-problem">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s problem is similar to that of many large organizations that have independent sub-communities within them.
We must centralize the operation and configuration of JupyterHubs in order to boost our efficiency in developing and operating them, but must also treat these hubs &lt;em>independently&lt;/em> because their user communities are not necessarily related, and because we want communities to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >be able to replicate their infrastructure on their own&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A year ago, we built the first version of our deployment infrastructure at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a>.
Over the last year of operation, we identified a number of major shortcomings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Within a Kubernetes cluster, we deployed hubs sequentially, not in parallel. This grew out of a common practice of
&lt;a href="https://sre.google/workbook/canarying-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Canary deployments&lt;/a> that allowed us to test changes on a &lt;strong>staging hub&lt;/strong> before rolling them out to a &lt;strong>production hub&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We used a single configuration file for all hubs within a cluster, which led to confusion and difficulty in identifying a hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moreover, any change to a hub within a cluster caused a re-deploy of &lt;em>all hubs on that cluster&lt;/em>. This is because we did not know whether a given change touched cluster-wide configuration or hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="our-goal">
Our goal
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-goal">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, we spent several weeks discussing a plan to resolve these major problems - here were our goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We should be able to &lt;strong>upgrade a specific hub&lt;/strong> alone, by inspecting which configuration files have been added or modified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production hubs should be upgraded in parallel&lt;/strong> when they are effectively run independently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should &lt;strong>use staging hubs as &amp;ldquo;canary&amp;rdquo; deployments&lt;/strong> and not continue upgrading production hubs if the staging hub fails.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="an-overview-of-our-changes">
An overview of our changes
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#an-overview-of-our-changes">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>To accomplish this, we needed to identify which hub required an upgrade based on file additions/modifications.
This took a lot of discussion and iteration on design, and so we share it below in the hopes that it is helpful to others!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="improvements-to-our-code-and-structure">
Improvements to our code and structure
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#improvements-to-our-code-and-structure">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We made a few major changes to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the infrastructure repository&lt;/a> to facilitate the deployment logic described above.
Here are the major changes we implemented:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We separated each hub&amp;rsquo;s configuration into its own file, or set of files. For example,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/staging.values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>staging&lt;/code> hub configuration&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We created a separate &lt;code>cluster.yaml&lt;/code> file that holds the canonical list of hubs deployed to that cluster and the configuration file(s) associated with each one. For example,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s GKE cluster configuration&lt;/a>, which contains a reference to the previously mentioned
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml#L14-L26" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >staging hub&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We updated
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/master/deployer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our deployer module&lt;/a> to do the following things:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inspect the list of files modified in a Pull Request.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From this list, calculate the name of a hub that required an upgrade, and the name of its respective cluster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys changes in parallel for each cluster/hub pair.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to these structural and code changes, we also developed new GitHub Actions workflows that control the entire process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-github-actions-workflow-for-upgrading-our-jupyterhubs">
A GitHub Actions workflow for upgrading our JupyterHubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-github-actions-workflow-for-upgrading-our-jupyterhubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We defined a new GitHub Actions workflow that carries out the logic described above.
These are all defined in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-hubs.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this &lt;code>deploy-hubs.yaml&lt;/code> configuration file&lt;/a>.
Here are the major jobs in this workflow, and what each does:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>generate-jobs&lt;/code>: Generate a list of clusters/hubs that must be upgraded, given the files that are changed in a Pull Request.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Evaluate an input list of added/modified files in a PR&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide if the added/modified files warrant an upgrade of a hub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generate a list of hubs and clusters that require upgrades, and some extra details:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does the support chart that is deployed to the cluster also need an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does a staging hub on this cluster require an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This produced two outputs to be used in subsequent steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &lt;strong>human-readable table&lt;/strong> including information on &lt;em>why&lt;/em> a given deployment requires an upgrade (using the excellent
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Rich library&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JSON outputs&lt;/strong> that can be interpreted by GitHub Actions as sets of matrix jobs to run.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/li>

Concluding Remarks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#concluding-remarks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We think that this is a nice balance of infrastructure complexity and flexibility.
It allows us to separate the configuration of each hub and cluster, which makes each more maintainable by us, and is more aligned with a community&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a> their infrastructure.
It allows us to remove the interdependence of deploy jobs that do not &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to be dependent, which makes our deploys more efficient.
Finally, it allows us to make &lt;em>targeted deploys&lt;/em> more effectively, which reduces the amount of toil and unnecessary waiting associated with each change. (It also
&lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-04-22-environmental-sustainability-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >reduces our carbon footprint by reducing unnecessary GitHub Action time&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this is a useful resource for others to follow if they also maintain JupyterHubs for multiple communities.
If you have any ideas of how we could further improve this infrastructure, please reach out on GitHub!

This is a quick post to celebrate the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past three months, and to briefly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main highlights from this quarter - if you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out more of the work that we&amp;rsquo;ve done, see:&lt;/p>

Infrastructure improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#infrastructure-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This quarter we did a deep dive into a number of core infrastructure improvements for our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Managed JupyterHubs Service&lt;/a>.
Here are a few highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infrastructure reliability and efficiency&lt;/strong>. We
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/879" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >improved the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of our deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>. For example, we refactored our hub configuration so that each community is better-able to track it, we implemented validation steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally push incorrect config to the hubs, and we&amp;rsquo;ve significantly improved our CI/CD pipeline to push deployments out to our hubs more efficiently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automatic deployments to commercial cloud&lt;/strong>. With the ICESat hackweek as a test-case for AWS, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished automating the deployment of clusters and hubs to each major commercial cloud. (there&amp;rsquo;s not a specific issue for this as it has been a multi-month effort over many PRs and issues!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CILogon authentication&lt;/strong>.
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CILogon&lt;/a> is a non-profit organization that provides &amp;ldquo;single-sign on&amp;rdquo; authentication services for the same communities that 2i2c serves. We&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with them to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/1089" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >prototype using CILogon for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s hubs&lt;/a>, which should make it much easier for communities to user their own institutional sign-ons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">
Communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served and lessons learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As described in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our Managed Hub Services strategy&lt;/a>, our goals for this phase of our organization are to balance &lt;em>serving communities of practice&lt;/em> and &lt;em>learning where we can improve our infrastructure and practices&lt;/em>.
With that in mind, here are a few highlights of communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served, and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We grew a hub for
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the University of Toronto&lt;/a> to around 4000 monthly users&lt;/strong>. This has taught us a lot about where our support and operations can and cannot scale, and where we have gaps in our sustainability / pricing model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed CILogon on a hub for
&lt;a href="https://anu.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a class at Australian National University&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This gives us an opportunity to work out any UX issues and improvements to be made before a deeper CILogon integration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a dedicated database per user for
&lt;a href="https://utexas.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a databases course at UT Austin&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This is helping us learn more about how to pair slightly more customized per-user infrastructure with our standard hub setups, as well as how our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Right to Replicate model&lt;/a> could be followed for more complex setups like a database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scotty_h_q/status/1508557909751320577" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the ICESat2 HackWeek&lt;/a> at the University of Washington&lt;/strong>. This helped refine our infrastructure and expertise with AWS, as well as improved our event &amp;ldquo;ready mode&amp;rdquo; practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a new hub for
&lt;a href="https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the LEAP project&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This has given us an opportunity to prototype new processes for pass-through cloud costs to simplify our deployments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizational improvements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond our technical and community impact work, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of significant organizational improvements as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >new role in Product and Community Management&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re excited for this new hire to spearhead efforts in guiding and developing relationships with the communities we serve, as well as guiding and collaborating with our engineering team in developing our services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/382" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a new Project Manager role&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Our engineering team had been operating as a largely autonomous and independent group, but we&amp;rsquo;ve realized that we would benefit from someone to help coordinate our actions and plans, especially as we balance more operations/support issues in addition to new development. This new role is an experiment at growing this capacity within our team, in the hopes that we can dedicate a team member to it in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We are still working out our major priorities for the oncoming quarter, but have a few major projects in the works that we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful to make progress on quickly.
Here are a few major examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our process and operations around supporting our users&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1068" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >discussing first- and second-line support processes&lt;/a> to make our team more responsive and effective at resolving incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and contracting process&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/355" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >discussing how to reduce toil associated with invoicing&lt;/a> in order to make this practice more reliable and efficient, along with our fiscal sponsor
&lt;a href="https://codeforscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving our reporting and monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;d like to boost our ability to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >monitor activity on each of our hubs&lt;/a> in order to identify when something abnormal is happening and get ahead of any potential problems (e.g., to avoid unintentionally large cloud bills). We&amp;rsquo;d also like to improve our usage reporting to more create more accurate cloud bills for hubs running on multi-tenant clusters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a lot more planned for 2i2c, and if you&amp;rsquo;re curious to see what we&amp;rsquo;re up to, we invite you to
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >check out our team compass&lt;/a> to learn about our practices, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >watch our activity on GitHub&lt;/a> to see our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to the amazing 2i2c team, and the multiple open source and scholarly communities that we collaborate with to make all of this possible. In addition, we are grateful to
&lt;a href="" >our funders&lt;/a> for making this possible. We are looking forward to Q2! 🎉&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes from our drop-in meeting about the Product and Community Lead role</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday we had a quick &amp;ldquo;drop-in&amp;rdquo; session to take questions about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/" >job posting for a Product and Community Lead&lt;/a>.
We spent the hour discussing a number of questions that others had about the position.
Below is a short overview of the questions and some responses, for those who were not able to attend.
These responses are a bit rough, since they are mostly off-the-cuff based on the questions asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2022-03-24&lt;/strong>: We&amp;rsquo;ve added extra questions and answers below from our latest drop-in meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-success-look-like-in-the-short-and-long-term">
What does success look like in the short and long term?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-success-look-like-in-the-short-and-long-term">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is an important question, with a few different kinds of answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As noted, this is the first hire of its kind inside of 2i2c, and it should bring a strategic and organization-building eye to the work that it does.
To some extent, this role will be tasked with coming up with their own answers to these questions.
This person should build a near- and long-term strategy for how Product and Community Engagement should evolve to be most-effective in accomplishing our mission.
This will also mean defining goals and a strategy to meet these goals over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind, here are a few ideas we have in mind for goals that will drive this role:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6 month goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Become familiar with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organization, culture, mission, and team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define an early strategy for how you&amp;rsquo;d like to incorporate Product and Community engagement into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s operations, and set some Objectives or Key Results that we should use to measure success. This should include a plan for the two major objectives of this role: guiding and connecting with the communities we serve, and building design and planning processes that bring this perspective into our engineering and services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A few iterations on the execution of this strategy, with some demonstration of impact as well as some documented lessons learned.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 year goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An organizational strategy and structure has been created, defining the various roles that make up this division of 2i2c and their functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clearly defined team processes for major programs efforts that this role oversees, as well as interconnections with other major divisions of 2i2c (e.g. engineering or sales). For example, a framework for training community leaders and mechanisms or platforms for communication and engagement with our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A team exists that carries out these efforts, led by the Product and Community Lead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clear demonstrated impact in the communities we serve, according to the OKRs and goals that have been set in this division.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-2i2c-provide-mentorshiponboarding">
How does 2i2c provide mentorship/onboarding?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-2i2c-provide-mentorshiponboarding">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>You can find
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/get-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our onboarding process in our Team Compass&lt;/a>.
This roughly comes down to choosing an &amp;ldquo;Onboarding Champion&amp;rdquo; for the new team member, to help walk them through our team processes and get them access to the right information and accounts.
However, 2i2c is quite young, so has only had a few iterations in onboarding new team members.
We look forward to improving this process further via this new hire.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-largest-challenges-that-someone-might-face-in-their-first-year-in-this-position">
What are the largest challenges that someone might face in their first year in this position?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-largest-challenges-that-someone-might-face-in-their-first-year-in-this-position">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The largest challenge is largely related to ambiguity and fluidity of this role, due to the fact that 2i2c is small and relatively young.
As noted above, this position will have a great deal of autonomy, and will be expected to show leadership in defining the nature of this work within 2i2c.
This can either be exciting or scary depending on your comfort level with ambiguity!
We recognize that it is an anti-pattern to have roles without clearly-defined measures of success, so we&amp;rsquo;re committed to defining this quickly in partnership with the new hire.
However, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be overly-prescriptive in this role, because we want it to have space to lead these efforts within 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-hope-to-protect-the-business-aspects-of-2i2c-if-all-the-tech-is-open-source">
How do you hope to protect the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; aspects of 2i2c, if all the tech is open source?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-you-hope-to-protect-the-business-aspects-of-2i2c-if-all-the-tech-is-open-source">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is to some extent committing to a limiting business model: by respecting the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a>, we &lt;em>encourage&lt;/em> other organizations to perform the exact same kinds of services that 2i2c offers.
However, we believe this is in-line with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission, and would consider this to be a measure of impact rather than a sustainability problem.
In short: our goal is not to become a tech giant or start-up unicorn, we want to sustain a team with competitive pay, and we want to scale as there is more opportunity to serve new communities.
We believe that the complexity of integrating tools and managing cloud services means that there will always be enough of an opportunity to bring in ample funding for this model.
We also hope that our mission-driven nature and focus on research and education will bring in new kinds of funding opportunities that can sustain 2i2c and its mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-would-applying-the-1000-true-fans-approach-work-in-terms-of-advocacy">
How would applying the &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; approach work in terms of advocacy?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-would-applying-the-1000-true-fans-approach-work-in-terms-of-advocacy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >1000 true fans&lt;/a> approach suggests that it is enough to leverage the support of &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; to sustain a product or service.
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered 2i2c in this light before, but believe it aligns well with our strategy.
A common pattern 2i2c follows is to build connections with &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; in the communities that we wish to serve.
These individuals are passionate about open science, open source, and community-led workflows.
They advocate for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s services, and also serve as leaders for the kinds of workflows that 2i2c wishes to enable.
We believe that our mission-alignment with research and education, and our focus on empowering community leaders, will position us to build support and dedicated collaborators across these sectors.
We also hope that by centering Jupyter infrastructure in the services we offer, we can benefit from the recognition and demand for this ecosystem via our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-challenges-have-you-run-into-thus-far">
What challenges have you run into thus far?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-challenges-have-you-run-into-thus-far">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are many things we could respond with here!
In this meeting, we discussed two major challenges we continue to iterate on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Walking the line between &amp;ldquo;software as a service&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;custom infrastructure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. 2i2c seeks to run infrastructure &lt;em>on behalf of&lt;/em> other communities, but in a scalable and sustainable way.
This means that we must centralize configuration and deployment, but use a standardized stack that benefits from economies of scale.
This is a complex problem, especially at the interface points with university bureacracies.
For example, many universities require a &lt;em>university email&lt;/em> in order to manage cloud infrastructure in their organization - doing this for each of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers is not a sustainable practice, and we must define creative ways to balance the security concerns of universities with our desire to run &lt;em>their&lt;/em> infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building a distributed organization from scratch&lt;/strong>. The other major challenge we&amp;rsquo;ve faced is simply the act of creating an organization from the ground up.
We have worked together for many years in open source communities, but there&amp;rsquo;s a new degree of complexity when you&amp;rsquo;re all working on the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> service and development efforts.
Throw in a largely asynchronous team split across many time zones, and there are a lot of coordination and planning challenges to overcome.
We have tried many things over the past year (see
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our latest team practices in the team compass&lt;/a>, but there is still a lot of improvement to make.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-crucial-is-a-deep-seated-knowledge-of-jupyter-for-this-role">
How crucial is a deep-seated knowledge of Jupyter for this role?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-crucial-is-a-deep-seated-knowledge-of-jupyter-for-this-role">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s not strictly required for somebody to have a knowledge of Jupyter, we think it will be an important part of this role (at least from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective).
This position is not an engineer, and won&amp;rsquo;t be expected to understand the inner-workings of Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.
However, it will be crucial that this role understand what is possible with JupyterHub, Notebooks, Jupyter Book, etc, and develop and teach best-practices in applying these tools for research and education.
They&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a deep &lt;em>intuition&lt;/em> for how to use Jupyter tools, how they should be improved, and how they can be integrated together for new services (along with other tools in the open source community).
More important than anything is a deep interest in this ecosystem, and a desire to learn, but having prior experience with the Jupyter stack and similar workflows will be a big benefit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-level-of-technical-expertise-is-needed-for-this-position">
What level of technical expertise is needed for this position?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-level-of-technical-expertise-is-needed-for-this-position">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ideally, they should have the expertise of a &amp;ldquo;power user&amp;rdquo; of the infrastructure and usecases that we work with.
We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this role to have software development or cloud infrastructure engineering expertise, but they should understand what it is like to &lt;strong>use&lt;/strong> these tools from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, and have an intuition about how to improve the workflows.
They should be able to communicate with and collaborate with engineers effectively, so understanding development workflows will be helpful, but they do not need core expertise in software development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-it-kind-of-like-a-scientific--technical-writer">
Is it kind of like a scientific / technical writer?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#is-it-kind-of-like-a-scientific--technical-writer">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The skills of a scientific or technical writer would certainly be relevant for this position.
For example, somebody that enjoyed technical documentation or scientific communication likely has one relevant skillset for this role.
However, the role will do much more than &lt;em>just&lt;/em> technical writing - they will also create and execute on organizational strategy, collaborate with our team around designing and planning our work, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-scientific-knowledge-in-a-specific-domain-important">
Is scientific knowledge in a specific domain important?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#is-scientific-knowledge-in-a-specific-domain-important">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this person to have deep knowledge in any particular scientific field, though experience with scientific and educational workflows in general will be very beneficial.
2i2c&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build expertise in the aspects of interactive computing workflows that overlap between many research / educational communities.
We hope to work with leaders from these communities to leverage their domain expertise, and to empower them to lead others.
Similar to having technical expertise, the important thing is having an intuition for what it&amp;rsquo;s like to use the infrastructure, what &lt;em>kinds of problems&lt;/em> our target communities are trying to solve, and how to learn more about their perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-the-role-involve-writing-grants-for-the-sustainability-of-the-project">
Does the role involve writing grants for the sustainability of the project?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-the-role-involve-writing-grants-for-the-sustainability-of-the-project">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This role isn&amp;rsquo;t tasked specifically with identifying and writing grants, though it is likely that they will collaborate with others at 2i2c in crafting grant language or pursuing similar opportunities.
2i2c is a small organization and so we all tend to wear many hats, though we try to keep each person&amp;rsquo;s efforts focused on their core responsibilities.
In this case, those responsibilities are community guidance and engagement, as well as service / product design in collaboration with our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-communications-would-this-role-oversee">
What kinds of communications would this role oversee?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-kinds-of-communications-would-this-role-oversee">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is hard to know right now and may evolve over time, but we expect this role will primarily communicate with pre-existing communities that we serve.
They will also foster communication between leaders within these communities.
They may interface with communities that 2i2c seeks to serve in the future (for example, in collaboration with sales and partnerships), but their focus will be on cultivating and guiding the communities we already work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="term-for-this-position">
Term for this position
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#term-for-this-position">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We hire all team members on one-year contracts with an annual review and the expectation to renew the contract for another year (unless we explicitly say otherwise).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-are-the-communities-you-work-with">
Where are the communities you work with?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#where-are-the-communities-you-work-with">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Here are a few characteristics of the communities we &lt;em>currently&lt;/em> work with, though we aspire to broaden this group significantly (for example, we wish to expand our focus outside of North American and Europe):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They tend to be focused in North America and in Europe (this is likely due to our pre-existing connections)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They cover a broad range of use-cases, from small- and large-scale education in single institutions, to small- and large-scale research communities that are distributed across the globe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A common pattern is to work with &amp;ldquo;community champions&amp;rdquo; that are interested in our technology and serve as leaders to bring these workflows to their respective communities. We seek to build more connections with people like this, and cultivate our relationship with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aspirationally, we hope to grow our reach to more communities outside of these countries, in order to achieve our mission of reaching a global audience.
Doing so will require more sophistication in our coordination and pricing, in order to match our services and support model with communities outside of North America and Europe.&lt;/p>

2i2c is young and without much structure. How do you plan to add more structure over time? What support will this role have?

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is the first role of its kind, and so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with a relatively fluid environment.
We all believe strongly in building good organizational support structures, but we are a young organization that is still developing this capacity internally.
Your immediate primary support system will be the other strategic leadership of 2i2c - the Executive Director, Steering Council members (on an ad-hoc basis), and other team members.
Over time, we look forward to building more formal support networks between divisions of 2i2c and our team members.&lt;/p>

Does this person need to be on an America/Europe time zone?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-this-person-need-to-be-on-an-americaeurope-time-zone">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The team is currently distributed between US/Pacific and Eastern European time zones, and this also matches the majority of communities we currently work with, so it will be important for this person to have several hours overlap with at least one of those two (the more the better).
In the short run, it is likely that a person within these time zones will have the least barriers to team and community collaboration.
However, we do not have any strict rules about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the longer term, we are committed to building distributed team practices that do not cause team members to pay large penalties for being in a particular time zone, and we look forward to finding creative solutions to this challenge.&lt;/p>

Position summary
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#position-summary">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This role will guide and empower the communities that we serve, learn from them, and bring their perspective to guide our service and product development. It is similar to a mixture of product management and community and developer advocacy in a tech firm, but adjusted for research, education, and open source contexts. It is also similar to a
&lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>Research Applications Manager&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, but with a focus on using and developing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The skills required are a combination of communication, teaching, learning, service design and delivery, and technical acumen. The person that fills this role should feel comfortable learning and sharing ideas, empowering and guiding others, and communicating clearly and collaboratively with a variety of stakeholders including end-users and engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a leadership role for a strategy-minded practitioner. 2i2c is a young organization, and this role will have a large degree of autonomy and flexibility. We have defined the starting point, but we seek someone who can bring a strategic eye to this position. Over time we hope that the role will grow to define and lead this style of work within 2i2c more broadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-youll-do">
What you’ll do
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-youll-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This role is a combination of connecting, guiding, leading, learning, communicating, and empowering stakeholders in the communities we serve, as well as the 2i2c engineering team. Here are some key focus areas with core responsibilities under each:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="guiding-and-learning-from-communities-we-serve">
Guiding and learning from communities we serve
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#guiding-and-learning-from-communities-we-serve">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our users are often not &amp;ldquo;power-users&amp;rdquo; with Jupyter, open source workflows, or cloud-native workflows. This role should work with users of these communities to guide them in using our infrastructure for maximal impact. Below are a few example responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Understand the goals and needs of the communities we serve&lt;/strong>, as well as the major pain points and problems that they have. This understanding may not be directly communicated and will be gained through active observation. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create and engage in spaces for sharing information with users.&lt;/strong> For example, online forums and live community discussions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engage in community-specific spaces.&lt;/strong> This role may monitor and participate in community spaces in either research or education (e.g.,
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Pangeo forum&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://discourse.jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Jupyter forum&lt;/a>, or forums for education communities) to track relevant conversation and provide guidance as-needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Guide communities and their leaders for the use-cases that 2i2c wishes to enable&lt;/strong>, and how our infrastructure (Jupyter, JupyterHub, open source tools, etc) can be used to have the most impact. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop user-facing materials&lt;/strong> (documentation, workshops, talks, etc) that demonstrate the basic use-cases that we support, and the best ways that the infrastructure can be used to accomplish community goals. For example “Teaching with Jupyter” or “An Introduction to Scalable Computing with Dask.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Provide one-on-one or group guidance to our user communities&lt;/strong> (particularly leaders in those communities) with the goal of transferring knowledge that they can then share within their peers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Foster deeper external relationships and engagements&lt;/strong> with key communities of practice and partners that are important for 2i2c’s strategy, such as the
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo Project&lt;/a> (which is a key stakeholder for this role).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engage with potential communities and stakeholders&lt;/strong>, with a focus on demonstrating the use-cases we hope to support and generating new service contracts with these communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Communicate externally to demonstrate impact.&lt;/strong> For example, by participating in meetings, conferences, and other events where we have an opportunity to highlight the work that 2i2c does.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Interact extensively with open source communities&lt;/strong> that underlie our infrastructure, potentially serving in leadership roles and doing significant work to support these communities. There will be a particular focus on the Jupyter and PyData ecosystems.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Guide product and service design and implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#guide-product-and-service-design-and-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This role should understand the perspectives of our users and the use-cases we wish to enable, and bring this perspective to guide the evolution of our services and infrastructure. Below are a few example responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Represent user communities and communicate their needs&lt;/strong> to the engineering team, leadership team, and other stakeholders. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Discuss and shape ideas for development&lt;/strong> in collaboration with the engineering and sustainability teams within 2i2c. This may entail writing design documents and participating in GitHub issues and Pull Requests.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Discuss and shape how to evolve our services.&lt;/strong> Beyond focused development, this role should also help shape our strategic plan for evolving our service offerings, or designing services for new use-cases.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coordinate with and guide our team in implementation&lt;/strong> as we carry out development and service design. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Participate in team planning meetings and practices.&lt;/strong> For example, prioritization and planning in GitHub Issues, or in synchronous team meetings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collaborate with engineers throughout the implementation of enhancements to our infrastructure&lt;/strong>. For example, providing ongoing check-ins, guidance, and feedback via GitHub issues.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Strategic leadership
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#strategic-leadership">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This is the first position of its kind within 2i2c, and it will have freedom to shape its strategy and role with the organization. It should oversee the evolution and growth of this &lt;em>kind&lt;/em> of work within 2i2c, and develop organizational strategy for how to maximize our impact. Below are a few ways that this might occur (both independently and in partnership with others at 2i2c):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop a product and service culture&lt;/strong> that balances intuition, community research, and data to create delightful experiences and maximize our impact.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define key goals and evaluation criteria for the success of our communities&lt;/strong>, and work with others at 2i2c to measure and refine these goals, communicate our impact internally, and use this experience to refine our team processes and strategy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop an organizational strategy&lt;/strong> for how 2i2c should grow its service and community engagement operations over time, including making new hires, defining new roles, and defining interconnections between these roles and the broader 2i2c team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop a communications plan&lt;/strong> that communicates 2i2c’c impact and positions 2i2c as a leading advocate for community-owned interactive computing infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collaborate around sustainability and stakeholder engagement&lt;/strong>. 2i2c aims to sustain itself through a combination of paid services, grants, and stakeholder partnerships. This role will collaborate with others at 2i2c in defining and carrying out these efforts.&lt;/li>

&lt;li>Experience with &lt;strong>technical communication and documentation skills&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience at strategic development and building organizations or teams (particularly distributed or technology-focused ones).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Experience with &lt;strong>data science workflows&lt;/strong> in research, education, and scholarship, with a focus on open workflows and

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-new-role">
Why a new role?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-a-new-role">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When 2i2c began a year ago, we hired a team of engineers that had experience in cloud infrastructure, Jupyter, and open source ecosystems. In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve built out the infrastructure foundation for scalable interactive computing environments that are customizable for the community, and respects their
&lt;a href="" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, solely providing infrastructure is not enough. Working with the modern open source stack, using the cloud to its advantage, and bringing these tools into specific domains requires a lot of extra experience and expertise. We believe that 2i2c is in a good position to &lt;strong>provide guidance and support to leaders in the communities that we serve&lt;/strong>, allowing them to get up-to-speed with the infrastructure more effectively so that they can have an impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned that it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to &lt;strong>develop infrastructure in collaboration with the communities that we&amp;rsquo;re serving&lt;/strong>. A team of engineers tends to focus on code and infrastructure, and having a role that focuses on connecting with communities will give them an excellent perspective on what those communities need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this role will combine these two aspects to create a culture of learning, sharing, and guiding between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team and the communities that we work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-similar-roles">
What are similar roles?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-similar-roles">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We tried to find similar roles in the private and non-profit sector, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that was a perfect fit. However, there were a few close matches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is kind-of like a &lt;strong>product manager&lt;/strong> - their job is to understand the communities that we work with, and to use this to help us make decisions about what to build, how to present it, and how to engage with stakeholders. They will need to help us prioritize the work that is most impactful for our mission, and help us navigate trade-offs in the evolution of our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is also kind-of like a &lt;strong>customer success manager&lt;/strong> or a &lt;strong>developer advocate&lt;/strong> - they will guide and teach those in the communities we serve - particularly community leaders that go on to teach others - how to use our infrastructure most-effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, the closest role we could find is a relatively new one: the
&lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>Research Applications Manager&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. This is a role that has been pioneered by the Turing Institute, and is similarly described as a connector that brings together many perspectives and encourages a participatory, team-based approach to research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the reality is that the person in this role will ultimately get to shape the nature of their work within 2i2c. As a young organization, there is a lot of flexibility for creativity and experimentation in bringing new skillsets into our organization. We hope that the person who fills this role will be excited about growing a culture of team-based approaches to our engineering and collaborations, and to share this culture with the communities that we serve.&lt;/p>

In this year we have grown, experimented, and accomplished a lot - we have also faced challenges and learned as a team. Our primary goal in 2021 was to build a strong foundation for 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reflect on our work thus far, we&amp;rsquo;re writing three blog posts that describe progress in major areas of work towards this foundation for 2i2c.
These three areas are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Creating services for use-cases&lt;/strong> - these are our first managed infrastructure offerings for communities in research and education.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Developing cloud infrastructure and tools&lt;/strong> - this is the technical backbone that makes these services possible, built entirely on open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building an organizational foundation&lt;/strong> - this is the creation of our team structures, processes, and culture that help us carry out our mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This first post will focus on &lt;strong>services that we&amp;rsquo;ve created in our first year&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission is to facilitate use-cases in research and education via open source development and services. Throughout 2021 we ran several pilots to learn more about the needs of communities in research and education, and how we could build sustainable services that meet these needs. Here are some highlights for each major use-case we have targeted thus far:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="educational-community-hubs">
Educational community hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#educational-community-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A primary use-case that 2i2c seeks to enable is &lt;strong>collaborative, distributed educational spaces for learning with data&lt;/strong>. In 2021 we ran several pilots with educational communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A university-wide hub for the University of Toronto.&lt;/strong> This hub is used in a variety of classes throughout the university, and is made freely available to anyone with a UofT account. We hope to repeat this model for other university-wide communities, and have learned a lot about the challenges of working with particularly large educational communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Several hubs for community colleges across California.&lt;/strong> In partnership with UC Berkeley and CloudBank, we&amp;rsquo;ve run several hubs for nearly a dozen small community colleges teaching the
&lt;a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Data 8 curriculum&lt;/a> for their students. These hubs are lightweight and offer standardized environments for their students to use, in order to lower the cost of deploying and maintaining the hubs over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned">
What we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The organizational context around educational use-cases is different from research communities. Compared with research groups, educucational groups have more variance in their size (classes as small as 10 people and as large as 500) and think about cost &lt;strong>by the student&lt;/strong>, not as a lump sum. This means that our initial hub-based pricing model may not map cleanly onto educational contexts, and we need to improve the match of scalability and price to these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that for these communities, navigating all of the open source tools that are available for pedagogy is confusing! Everybody wants auto-grading but it&amp;rsquo;s unclear what is the &amp;ldquo;right tool for the job&amp;rdquo;. Tools like
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> have heavy use at &amp;ldquo;power universities&amp;rdquo; like UC Berkeley, but many others don&amp;rsquo;t know that it exists! We will need to invest more time into building guides and documentation that help others leverage these tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="research-in-the-cloud">
Research in the cloud
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#research-in-the-cloud">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to educational use-cases, we ran several pilots for research communities in order to leverage cloud infrastructure for scaling their work or collaborating more effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We migrated Pangeo’s cloud infrastructure to be run via 2i2c.&lt;/strong> The
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo Community&lt;/a> had been operating and developing their own JupyterHub for several years, but were looking for another organization to provide more reliable/sustained operations and support for their Pangeo Cloud Service. This year we migrated the service
&lt;a href="" >to run off of 2i2c’s deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A scalable cloud hub for a SWOT satellite team&lt;/strong>. The
&lt;a href="https://meom-group.github.io/projects/swot-st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MEOM research group at Grenoble&lt;/a> is doing work with the
&lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA SWOT satellite project&lt;/a>. However, the datasets generated from this project are huge, and only storable via the cloud. We&amp;rsquo;ve set up a JupyterHub to provide cloud-based access to this data, running a Pangeo-like environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-1">
What we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-learned-1">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Research communities tend to have more usecase-specific needs than educational ones. While introductory courses in data science tend to be similar across institutions, research needs are much more unique to the problem and team at hand. Moreover, they tend to want infrastructure that runs via institutional cloud accounts. This is possible due to the flexible nature of Jupyter and JupyterHub, but brings extra challenges in bureacracy and access permissions, given that 2i2c engineers usually are not members of these organizations already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, many research use-cases are based around the &lt;strong>location of the data&lt;/strong>. This is because data is the hardest thing to move from cloud to cloud. For this reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important to &lt;strong>bring interactive sessions to the data&lt;/strong>. Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem makes this possible, but we&amp;rsquo;d like to do more to make this easier. For example, users should be able to launch interactive sessions across many clusters or datacenters, regardless of their hub&amp;rsquo;s location. They should also have more customized control over their environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="distributed-events-and-hackweeks">
Distributed events and hackweeks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-events-and-hackweeks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we had a special use-case that is a hybrid of the previous two examples. Events and hackweeks are &lt;em>time-bounded&lt;/em>, &lt;em>focused on learning and doing&lt;/em>, but often &lt;em>with research workflows and communities&lt;/em>. They also tend to be more globally-distributed than a traditional research or education community.
See below for a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://coessing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> workshop is a summer school run in Ghana to share skills and workflows with researchers across Africa. It builds on workflows in the Pangeo ecosystem, and teaches attendees how to work with cloud-native data. By using a cloud-based JupyterHub for their workshop, attendees had direct access to data and compute in a way that would have been much more difficult to set up on local infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://linked.earth/paleoHackathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>PaleoHackWeek hackathons&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> were two hackathons around paleo/climate data workflows. They brought together a distributed community and use the 2i2c hub to facilitate the use of the
&lt;a href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >paleoclim package&lt;/a> throughout the hackweek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.openscapes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>OpenScapes&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. They have several cohorts of scientific trainees learning more about adopting open and collaborative workflows, and use a hub managed by 2i2c to provide remote learning environments for their workshops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-2">
What we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-learned-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Initially we assumed that event-based hubs would be similar to educational use-cases. However, in practice they are more complex. First, event organizers have ever-changing communities of users on their hubs. They often want to provide access to many new users in each event, and expect only a small subset to continue using the infrastructure after an event. Finally, one-off events also generate spikes in activity that are more intense than educational use-cases, and warrant more dedicated attention from our engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-that-we-faced">
Challenges that we faced
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-that-we-faced">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As we piloted these use-cases, we also ran into a few challenges in designing services around our infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Balancing standard deployments, custom deployments, and scalability&lt;/strong>. Our goal is to centralize our deployment and operations infrastructure in order to reduce the maintenance burden for each community hub. This will allow us to gain economies of scale and lower costs. However, there’s an inherent tension between scalability and customizability - in order to scale we must standardize the infrastructure we offer, but communities often want environments that are unique to their use-case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Turning services into sustainability&lt;/strong>. We’ve learned that charging money for things does not come naturally to us. We’ve spent many years building technology and services that were offered freely to the public. This was easy to provide, but difficult to sustain. 2i2c’s goal is to offer similar services, but with a sustainability model that allows us to employ team members to do this work, and to grow in the future. Understanding how to pair the right technology, use-case, and service with a particular pricing model is an area where we must learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Piloting all of these services taught us a lot about the similarities and differences between each use case. Towards the end of 2021, this led to 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first collection of &amp;ldquo;service offerings&amp;rdquo; for a Managed Jupyter Service. This includes a 2-by-2 matrix of service options, and a specific price point for each. We have begun offering this service to communities, in order to learn more about the model, the pricing, and any changes that should be made. In early 2022, we hope to expand this group to more communities so that we can test this model’s ability to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our next post in this series will focus on the underlying technology that powers the services described above, stay tuned for more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo Cloud&lt;/a> is an experimental service providing public cloud-based data-science environments for data-intensive geoscience research.
We have recently finished re-creating the
&lt;a href="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a> community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a> repository.
This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one!
The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community.
It will be available at the same URL (
&lt;a href="https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io&lt;/a>) and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place.
Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work.
Please see
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/migration-of-us-central1-b-gcp-pangeo-io-to-2i2c-infrastructure/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this Discourse thread&lt;/a> as an initial place to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;strong>22nd November 2021&lt;/strong>, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub.
Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">
History of Pangeo Cloud Hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the
&lt;a href="https://annual.ametsoc.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting&lt;/a>; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs.
This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable.
Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure.
However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed.
Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">
The Pangeo-2i2c Partnership
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c&lt;/a> is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows.
We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem.
We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities.
Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project&amp;rsquo;s technical stacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities.
We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/notes-from-the-pangeo-2i2c-kick-off-meeting/1587" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >kick-off thread on Discourse&lt;/a>.
This approach allows each community to focus on it&amp;rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s workflows.
In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c.
Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community.
We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! &amp;#x1f680;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Community update Q3 2021: A new fiscal sponsor, improving our infrastructure, nearing an alpha launch.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we&amp;rsquo;re up to next. In addition, almost all of the work we do is public and discoverable across
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our GitHub repositories&lt;/a>, and is tracked by GitHub issues.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=org:2i2c-org&amp;#43;type:issue&amp;#43;is:closed&amp;#43;closed:2021-06-01..2021-10-01&amp;#43;-label:%22type:&amp;#43;team-sync%22&amp;#43;is:issue&amp;amp;type=issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of issues we&amp;rsquo;ve closed in ~Q3&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is amazing how quickly 4 months goes by when you&amp;rsquo;re building an organization from scratch! It seems like only a few weeks ago that we were recapping the beginning of the year in
&lt;a href="" >our last community update&lt;/a>. Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we&amp;rsquo;ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover major highlights, challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced, and where we&amp;rsquo;re going next.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">

&lt;h3 id="managed-jupyterhub-service">
Managed JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we&amp;rsquo;ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation across cloud providers&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/627" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >AWS&lt;/a> as well as
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Azure&lt;/a> to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Monitoring and reporting infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We have worked on the JupyterHub
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>grafana-dashboards&lt;/code> project&lt;/a> to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User environment management&lt;/strong>. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve improved the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker GitHub action&lt;/a> to work with more image registries, and created a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/hub-user-image-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c user image template repository&lt;/a> for users to re-use for their hubs. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/environment.html#bring-your-own-docker-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the User Environment docs&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support and collaboration roles&lt;/strong>. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the &lt;strong>community representative&lt;/strong> role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the user roles documentation&lt;/a> for more information. We have also begun prototyping a
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >FreshDesk support model&lt;/a> and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pangeo">
Pangeo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#pangeo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are working with &lt;strong>the Pangeo Community&lt;/strong> to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the
&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Executable Books Project&lt;/a>. As such, we have begun shifting our attention to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/493" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >create a strategy for sustaining the project&amp;rsquo;s community beyond this grant&lt;/a>. In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.&lt;/p>

JupyterHub community support
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-community-support">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We recently collaborated with the JupyterHub community to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/380" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >apply for two CZI EOSS awards&lt;/a>. Last month, we were notified that
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/jupyterhub-community-strategic-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our application to support a Community Strategic Lead&lt;/a> was funded! This role will fund Sarah Gibson&amp;rsquo;s time to focus some of her thinking on building community structures and dynamics that are inclusive and sustainable. We&amp;rsquo;ll update with more information as this project starts moving.&lt;/p>

Organizational foundations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-foundations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, in addition to our major development and projects, we have also made a lot of progress at an organizational level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>began
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/css-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a fiscal sponsorship with Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This provides a new organizational and legal home for 2i2c after spending nearly a year receiving
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >critical strategic and start-up support&lt;/a> from our previous host,
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ICSI&lt;/a>. We are excited to work with CS&amp;amp;S to create the business infrastructure that will power our managed JupyterHubs service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2i2c team has also been &lt;strong>improving our team planning and coordination processes&lt;/strong>, so that we can more effectively execute on our mission. As a distributed team, we have the challenge of building processes for team communication, coordination, and planning that are distributed and asynchronous. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you can learn more about our coordination processes in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our Team Compass&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have &lt;strong>improved our organization-wide documentation&lt;/strong> in order to make it easier to navigate between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s various sources of information. We hope that this provides more transparency into what 2i2c is up to and how it is structured, and that it allows us to build more connections between our projects and the broader community.

&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to making iterative improvements around the projects described above, we have a few major goals for the final quarter of 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>polish and finish the alpha-level deployment infrastructure&lt;/strong> across each of the major cloud providers. Our end goal is to be able to &lt;em>deploy a Kubernetes cluster and a JupyterHub on that cluster with minimal human effort&lt;/em>. This will allow us to serve more communities with fewer human effort per community. This includes migrating JupyterHubs for key communities, such as the Pangeo project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define and begin an alpha-level service&lt;/strong>. This means defining a few specific &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; that 2i2c can offer, as well as a pricing model for each product. Our goals will still be to learn about how this service should evolve, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more specificity about ways that others can engage with us. It will also be an opportunity to scale modestly so that we can improve our infrastructure as-needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define a longer-term vision&lt;/strong> for our Managed JupyterHubs Service, and create a plan for new workflows that we wish to enable via new development. We wish to use our experience in managing JupyterHubs to understand where new open source development would significantly help the communities we serve, and will shift our attention in this direction once we have finished the early stages of making our infrastructure more robust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for some more updates about this service, coming soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-weve-faced">
Challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-weve-faced">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we want to recognize that there are plenty of challenges along with successes when it comes to having impact! Here are a few of the unexpected challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve faced along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developing and operating multi-cloud infrastructure is a complex process&lt;/strong>. Automating the creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters across each of the major cloud providers has proven to be a lot of work! While it has been necessary to use our pre-existing hubs to provide the opportunity to build this infrastructure, it is a challenge to both &lt;em>build&lt;/em> and &lt;em>operate&lt;/em> infrastructure at the same time. This has lengthened our timelines for when we expect the alpha version of the service to be ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coordinating among a distributed team takes time&lt;/strong>. Each of our team members has been used to working asynchronously with open source communities for many years, and we under-estimated how complex it would be to port this workflow to a distributed team that must coordinate with each other much more closely on a daily basis. Deciding what to work on, how to work on it, and how to help one another take a lot of work when you only share a few hours awake at the same time. For this reason, we have spent a lot of extra energy in our first months as a team to work out
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >team processes for coordination and collaboration&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to design cloud services as a non-profit?&lt;/strong> Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is no clear roadmap for how to build a sustainable cloud service like the one we describe here. 2i2c is somewhere in-between a traditional SaaS company (which tends to provide access to proprietary technology) and a bespoke consultancy (which is more hands-on and custom than we are). Our best explanation for what 2i2c wishes to do is &amp;ldquo;Open source operations/dev-ops as a service&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into either category. This means that we have more &amp;ldquo;unknown unknowns&amp;rdquo; about what kind of service and pricing model we should develop. We hope to begin answering some of these questions in our alpha-level service launch. Stay tuned for more to come!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>2i2c’s organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2c’s co-founders have co-led for many years, including
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Pangeo Project&lt;/a>, the
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Syzygy Project&lt;/a>, the
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder Project&lt;/a>, and the
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/a>. These projects follow an “integrate, customize, and upstream” model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CS&amp;amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS&amp;amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS&amp;amp;S’s other initiatives in this space, including CS&amp;amp;S’s other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the
&lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/cs-s-launches-digital-infrastructure-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Digital Infrastructure Incubator program&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Achieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2c’s next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2c’s developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="" >funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>).
In that time we&amp;rsquo;ve made progress along several directions, and wish to use this blog post to provide updates about the ways in which 2i2c has evolved over the first months of its existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few major updates from the 2i2c community - as always, if you want to learn more about 2i2c, keep an eye
&lt;a href="" >on our blog&lt;/a> or subscribe to the
&lt;a href="" >2i2c mailing list&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="early-pilot-jupyterhub-infrastructure">
Early pilot JupyterHub infrastructure
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#early-pilot-jupyterhub-infrastructure">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off - we have been making progress building out our JupyterHub deployment infrastructure for 2i2c.
One of our major organizational goals is to build a sustainable service
&lt;a href="" >managing open source cloud infrastructure&lt;/a> for interactive computing.
This service will provide hosted, customized JupyterHubs for communities of practice in research and education.
They&amp;rsquo;ll be built entirely with open source tools that are community-driven, and that
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >respect the community&amp;rsquo;s Right to Replicate&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to accomplish this, 2i2c is running several pilots with partners and interested organizations, supported by our
&lt;a href="" >funding from CZI&lt;/a>, as well as from
&lt;a href="https://investinopen.org/blog/jrost-rapid-response-fund-awardees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the JROST rapid response fund&lt;/a>.
These pilots are meant to be learning opportunities to understand what kind of infrastructure and service it needs to build moving forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >documentation for our pilot hubs infrastructure&lt;/a> contains information about our deployments and infrastructure.
It is served from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this &lt;code>2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/code> repository&lt;/a>, a centralized location for configuring and deploying a federated network of JupyterHubs.
Each JupyterHub is independent of one another, and could be spun out from the centralized repository with minimal extra work, giving hub users the ability to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >replicate their infrastructure, with or without 2i2c&lt;/a>.
We will continue refining the code in this repository as we learn more from our hub infrastructure pilots.&lt;/p>

JupyterHub for geospatial analytics - A collaboration with Pangeo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-for-geospatial-analytics---a-collaboration-with-pangeo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/pangeo/pangeo-2-0-2bedf099582d" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >originally announced on the Pangeo blog&lt;/a>, 2i2c is forging a collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Pangeo project&lt;/a> around operating and developing cloud infrastructure for large-scale geospatial analytics!
This collaboration is funded through a grant from the Moore Foundation (via Pangeo investigator Ryan Abernathey).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the coming months, 2i2c plans to assume operation of infrastructure underlying the Pangeo project, allowing the Pangeo team to focus their efforts on their core scientific and development missions.
Because Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure is already running on a fully open source stack with JupyterHub, our first step will simply be to shift control over this infrastructure to 2i2c engineers.
We don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate needing to make major changes to their infrastructure and deployments (part of the benefits of using open, modular tools).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once this is complete, we&amp;rsquo;ll next shift our attention to some new areas of development that support use-cases in the Pangeo community (and in the scientific community more broadly).
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of progress that we imagine making - such as
&lt;a href="https://gallery.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >supporting sharing pipelines via the Pangeo Gallery&lt;/a> or improving tools for scalable computing with
&lt;a href="https://gateway.dask.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Dask Gateway&lt;/a>.
We&amp;rsquo;ll provide updates as we formally begin this collaboration and hash out a plan for our next steps.&lt;/p>

JupyterHub for education - A collaboration with CloudBank and UC Berkeley
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-for-education---a-collaboration-with-cloudbank-and-uc-berkeley">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership with the UC Berkeley
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Data Science in Undergraduate Studies program&lt;/a>, as well as
&lt;a href="http://cloudbank.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CloudBank&lt;/a>.
This collaboration aims to provide hosted JupyterHub infrastructure for community colleges across the state of California.
It is an attempt at providing vendor-agnostic and open-source infrastructure to several institutions who would otherwise not be able to deploy this infrastructure on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will provide the deployment and configuration architecture for this collaboration, working with
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-morris-5847aa2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sean Morris&lt;/a> in operating this educational infrastructure.
All of the cloud infrastructure for this pilot will be funded via CloudBank.
We will begin by offering environments that are modeled after
&lt;a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Data 8 course at UC Berkeley&lt;/a>.
This is part of an effort to build a community of practice around Data Science education using open source tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-team-members">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also welcomed two new members to the 2i2c core team! 🎉&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These individuals will both work towards
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/projects/" >2i2c&amp;rsquo;s major projects&lt;/a>, and collaborate together on running our 2i2c Pilot Hub infrastructure.

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, while it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in technology and collaborations, 2i2c has also made important steps towards defining a stable and transparent organizational model moving forward.
2i2c now
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/about/structure.html#steering-council" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >has a Steering Council&lt;/a> and an
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/about/structure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >early organizational structure&lt;/a>.
In addition,
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >we&amp;rsquo;ve defined a one-year bootstrap strategy&lt;/a> that we&amp;rsquo;ll use to guide our path in the first year of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, one of the first acts of the Steering Council has been to
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/code-of-conduct/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >adopt a Code of Conduct&lt;/a>.
This is a set of guidelines, and a process for resolving incidents, that makes our community more inclusive, equitable, and enjoyable for all.
Creating a Code of Conduct is a crucial part of defining our organizational and community culture, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to have some explicit guidelines to support our interactions in the future!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="keep-in-touch">
Keep in touch
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#keep-in-touch">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Now that we are improving our organizational foundation, we will try to post more frequent updates and discussions about what we are up to.
We hope for 2i2c to be a model organization in participatory, collaborative, transparent operations, and we look forward to working with you all in the future on this journey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2i2c partners with UC Berkeley and CloudBank to provide data science education hubs for community colleges in California</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/data8-class/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/data8-class/</guid><description>&lt;p>

Who we are
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#who-we-are">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a non-profit organization with a mission to make interactive computing more accessible, scalable, and powerful for research and education. We strive to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support data workflows in research and education through infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support open tools and communities that underlie this infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We accomplish this mission by providing managed cloud services for interactive computing, by providing development and technical leadership to researchers and educators that utilize this infrastructure for specific communities, and by providing support for open source tools and communities in this ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have deep ties to the open source community, and have been leaders and core contributors across dozens of projects - in particular in the Jupyter ecosystem. We also have deep ties to research and education - our team has spent years deploying infrastructure for universities, community colleges, and research teams, and now we’re bringing this experience to a wider audience with 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe strongly in communities that are inclusive, transparent, equitable, effective, and diverse, especially 2i2c itself. We believe that our values should permeate everything about 2i2c, including the work we do, the communities we serve, and our own organizational culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is a project of the
&lt;a href="https://icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>, a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>You will define the overall strategy and technical approach to cloud computing usage in Pangeo, and will interface with the Pangeo community on a frequent basis. You will help deploy, customize, and operate cloud infrastructure for research and interactive computing. You&amp;rsquo;ll use the experience operating this infrastructure to identify development opportunities, with the goal of minimizing maintenance time and toil - your goal will be to spend &lt;em>more time developing&lt;/em> and &lt;em>less time operating&lt;/em>. You will contribute to the general development and maintenance of open source software packages for the advancement of scientific objectives, and develop applications for extracting, transforming, loading, managing, and cataloging scientific data in the cloud. You will engage and interact with open source communities surrounding the tools that you use in serving the Pangeo community, and will represent 2i2c in these engagements. You will also collaborate with scientists to support research projects, and may conduct some education and training around scientific computing.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="" >announced the creation of 2i2c&lt;/a>, a non-profit initiative dedicated to improving and facilitating access to infrastructure for interactive computing workflows in research and education. Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>. You can find
&lt;a href="https://cziscience.medium.com/scaling-open-infrastructure-and-reproducibility-in-biomedicine-69546a399747" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CZI&amp;rsquo;s announcement here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of this post is a short run-down of what we&amp;rsquo;ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-big-picture">
The big picture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-big-picture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In recent years, several projects including
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Syzygy&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Berkeley DataHubs&lt;/a> have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are two keys goals for this grant:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">
Goal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support
&lt;a href="" >Chris Holdgraf&lt;/a> to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">
Goal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c will offer hosted
&lt;a href="" >interactive computing infrastructure&lt;/a> utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first hire -
&lt;a href="" >Georgiana Dolocan&lt;/a> as an &lt;strong>Open Source Infrastructure Engineer&lt;/strong>. Georgiana has been the
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/the-jupyterhub-and-binder-contributor-in-residence-56708d1e3069" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Contributor in Residence&lt;/a> for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Georgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/outreachy-jupyter-supporting-diversity-in-open-communities-dfa78db4b0bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an outreachy internship&lt;/a> followed by
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/cir-report-i-1ca418c230cd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a term as Contributor in Residence&lt;/a>. Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the
&lt;a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Berkeley Institute for Data Science&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://numfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NumFOCUS&lt;/a> for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CZI EOSS grant series&lt;/a> for funding the original Contributor in Residence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its
&lt;a href="" >JupyterHub pilot deployments&lt;/a> to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please
&lt;a href="" >reach out to 2i2c&lt;/a> and let us know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally. We also believe it will lead to major advancements in supporting interactive computing workflows for research and education. We look forward to what the next three years will bring!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>👋 hey everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the creation of a new non-profit organization&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that we call &lt;strong>2i2c&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c stands for &lt;strong>The International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/strong>. It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="why-create-2i2c">
Why create 2i2c?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-create-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including
&lt;a href="" >bringing data science education to thousands of students&lt;/a>, connecting
&lt;a href="" >geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud&lt;/a>, and providing
&lt;a href="" >federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada&lt;/a>, to name a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that &lt;em>development&lt;/em> and &lt;em>support&lt;/em> of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-non-profit">
Why a non-profit?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-a-non-profit">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It may sound strange to create a non-profit initiative when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research and educational communities&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Researchers and educators who need development&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that offers development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source communities&lt;/strong>, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud providers&lt;/strong>, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supporters of open source&lt;/strong> who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-going-to-do">
What are we going to do?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-we-going-to-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here&amp;rsquo;s a rough picture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Offer
&lt;a href="" >&lt;strong>hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. These will
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >be entirely open source&lt;/a> and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They&amp;rsquo;ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >the 2i2c &lt;strong>Right to Replicate&lt;/strong> document&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="" >&lt;strong>collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community&amp;rsquo;s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="" >&lt;strong>core development and community support&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for open source projects that we use. While many organizations &lt;em>use&lt;/em> Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they &lt;em>give back&lt;/em> to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-steps">
Next steps
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#next-steps">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months. Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be up to next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first step is to &lt;strong>understand how interactive computing can best-serve the research and education communities&lt;/strong>. We know that interactive computing tools work in our specific use-cases, but how do these generalize to other domains or types of organizations? Moreover, how can we improve the open source tools to make them even more customizable for each community?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll begin answering this question through several focused JupyterHub pilots aimed at different use-cases across research and education:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A &amp;ldquo;Hubs for All&amp;rdquo; pilot for education&lt;/strong>. This will focus on making standard educational environments via JupyterHub accessible to a broad range of educational institutions, in particular, traditionally under-resourced institutions such as community colleges, state colleges, and HBCUs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research-focused hubs for earth analytics&lt;/strong>. Research requires more complex and customized infrastructure than education, and so we are piloting hub infrastructure for a few specific research communities to understand how we can meet their needs. We will use this to better-understand how 2i2c and support a diverse research community in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JupyterHub development for the Pangeo Project&lt;/strong>. Pangeo has been a collaborator of 2i2c since day one, and we love its vision for large-scale earth analytics via cloud infrastructure. We plan to work closely with Pangeo leadership to work on early development of tools aimed at facilitating scalable computing for research on Pangeo infrastructure. More information about this to come soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll also use these pilots to &lt;strong>develop an organizational sustainability model&lt;/strong> around this infrastructure. It takes expertise to manage and develop cloud infrastructure, and 2i2c wishes to pay market rates for its engineers. How can 2i2c offer services and development in a way that is sustainable both for itself and for other institutions? We&amp;rsquo;ll use these pilots to create a plan for both sustaining and scaling 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s ability to serve institutions and teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-we-need">
What do we need?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-we-need">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c has a long road ahead of it. We cannot take venture capital funding, so we have to raise funds the old-fashioned way. This means that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are at an organization interested in purchasing hosted JupyterHub environments from 2i2c, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are a funder or are otherwise interested in supporting 2i2c with a donation or grant, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have experience in sustaining service-based organizations such as 2i2c, and wish to offer your expertise or guidance, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ll likely be hiring in the coming months for open source engineers, with a focus on data science, interactive computing, and the cloud. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working for an organization like 2i2c, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>, and keep an eye on this space as we will post more information soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a community&amp;rsquo;s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c. We make these commitments because we believe that using infrastructure that follows these principles will lead to a more fair, just, equitable world. We also believe they are the right foundation for more productive and impactful research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is committed to running its own infrastructure on open-source tools and vendor-agnostic infrastructure, though it does not &lt;em>force&lt;/em> users to use only open-source tools in their own environments, code, and data. Below is a table describing how the Right to Replicate fits into 2i2c hub technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Definitions of &lt;code>MUST&lt;/code>, &lt;code>MUST NOT&lt;/code>, &lt;code>SHOULD&lt;/code>, &lt;code>MAY&lt;/code>, etc are defined in

&lt;/tr>
&lt;tr>
&lt;td>2i2c Infrastructure&lt;/td>
&lt;td>&lt;strong>Must&lt;/strong> be Open Source&lt;/td>

&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Below we describe our commitments in our own infrastructure stack in more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-2i2c-infrastructure-ensures-this-right">
How 2i2c infrastructure ensures this right
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-2i2c-infrastructure-ensures-this-right">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c infrastructure and documentation for it MUST BE as transparent &amp;amp; accessible as possible, so communities can replicate our configuration without having to extract any ‘secret sauce’ from 2i2c. If they choose to, they can also inspect, audit &amp;amp; modify the infrastructure they are paying for and using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure the Right to Replicate to our communities, 2i2c makes the following commitments to infrastructure we build and operate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We MUST use only open source software to run our infrastructure. By only using software that is available to everyone on the same terms, we can ensure that communities can replicate the infrastructure without having to negotiate licensing terms with proprietary software vendors. In addition, any changes we make to open source software will be made in public and/or contributed upstream, so communities continue to have access to them regardless of where their infrastructure is.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We MUST NOT directly depend on proprietary cloud vendor specific products or APIs. Instead, we use cloud-managed open source software, or hide the dependency behind a layer of abstraction. This ensures that communities can port their infrastructure to any cloud provider of their choice, or run it on their own hardware with purely open source software.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This set of commitments acts as a business continuity plan for our partner communities, ensuring 2i2c will follow best practices within the open source, open education and open research ecosystems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title/><link>https://2i2c.org/about/funding/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/about/funding/</guid><description>

&lt;/h1>&lt;p>To sustain and grow our operations, 2i2c receives funding from the following sources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Revenue from managed services&lt;/strong>. We build self-sustaining cloud services that generate revenue through management and support contracts. See
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/platform/" >our services page&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Project-focused grants&lt;/strong>. We lead and collaborate on several projects that involve developing and supporting infrastructure for research and education. See
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/projects/" >our projects page&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Core organizational support&lt;/strong>. We raise core funding that covers the costs of strategically-critical roles that are not easily linked to specific deliverables and contracts.&lt;/li>

Our commitment to open technology
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-commitment-to-open-technology">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>This page describes 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s commitment to developing and contributing to infrastructure that is open source now and into the future. More context can be found
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/community-ownership/" >in this blog post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>Definitions of MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY, etc are defined in
&lt;a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >RFC 2119&lt;/a>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>All engineering artifacts (code, documentation, etc) produced by 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineering team MUST be licensed under an open source license approved by a non-profit organization that is not 2i2c.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Open Source Projects originating at 2i2c, or stewarded by 2i2c, MUST NOT require a
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Contributor Licensing Agreement&lt;/a> that includes Copyright Assignment to 2i2c. &lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The list of external organizations that define licenses we accept are&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>:

&lt;/ol>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Modifying (1), (2), or (3) MUST be done through a 2/3 majority vote of 2i2c staff. &lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These commitments ensure 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s ongoing support for open source technology and community-owned infrastructure, and constrain us from &lt;em>changing&lt;/em> this commitment in a way that would harm our communities. We hope that this builds trust with our communities to rely on 2i2c as a provider and a steward of their infrastructure.

&lt;p>This constrains us from writing proprietary engineering code or creating proprietary products. Note that this only applies to 2i2c artifacts, and not those that are created by our member communities.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:2">
&lt;p>Protects from the most common &amp;ldquo;bait and switch&amp;rdquo; licensing problem, where being the sole copyright owner of a project allows us to change the license in the future because we&amp;rsquo;ve retained ownership over all the code.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:3">
&lt;p>This constrains us from creating a new non profit that rubberstamps a license that is fundamentally proprietary, while still allowing for experimentation with licenses that try to innovate on OSI.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:3" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:4">
&lt;p>This sets an intentionally-high bar for modifying this policy. In 2025 we aim to re-establish our steering council along with a community advisory board that is tasked with defining policy like this. In the interrim, we choose &lt;code>2/3 of the organization&lt;/code> to be a reasonably high bar for changing this policy&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:4" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Use and support our managed JupyterHub services
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#use-and-support-our-managed-jupyterhub-services">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c aims to provide Managed JupyterHubs in the cloud that are customized for communities in research and education.
We are exploring sustainability and services models around this goal, and invite feedback and ideas for ways that we can improve this service.
We are running JupyterHubs for many communities already, and are accepting new communities in batches as our capacity grows.
If you are interested in having a managed JupyterHub for your community,
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/platform/" >check out our cloud service page&lt;/a> for more information or send an email to
&lt;a href="" >&lt;code>partnerships@2i2c.org&lt;/code>&lt;/a> to discuss.&lt;/p>
