We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to experiment with a &lt;strong>monthly community update&lt;/strong> to create a regular cadence of transparency and highlights from 2i2c for our broader community.
This is the first such update, so bear with us as we work out the kinks!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal with these updates is to share what stands out at 2i2c - what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned, what we&amp;rsquo;re proud of, where we&amp;rsquo;ve struggled, and where we&amp;rsquo;ve had an impact.
We hope this can be a historical record of &amp;ldquo;what stands out&amp;rdquo; to our team and that it is useful for our broader community to see.
We also want this to be relatively short and to the point to make it sustainable to both write and read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;d love feedback&lt;/strong> on what else you&amp;rsquo;d like to see.
If you have any ideas, please send an email to &lt;code>hello@2i2c.org&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

Rough Numbers
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#rough-numbers">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off, a few numbers on the scale and status of our interactive computing hub service:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are currently running around &lt;strong>73 JupyterHubs&lt;/strong> that are collectively averaging more than &lt;strong>4000 average monthly users&lt;/strong>.
We have several communities in the educational sector, so October was a peak in the Fall semester of activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re recovering roughly &lt;strong>40% of our monthly staffing costs through recurring service revenue&lt;/strong>.
The remainder we&amp;rsquo;re making up with a combination of grants and more focused development contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming minimal growth in our service and fundraising, our &lt;strong>runway is roughly until August 2025&lt;/strong> - however, we anticipate this to shrink in the short-term once we make critical new hires in the coming months.&lt;/p>

Improving Our Quarterly Sprints and Goals
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#improving-our-quarterly-sprints-and-goals">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This month our team kicked off the second round of our new quarterly sprints and goals process.
This is an attempt to focus our team around a few goals and sub-teams dedicated to them throughout each quarter.
Our hope is that this allows us to make strategic &amp;ldquo;pushes&amp;rdquo; in directions that feel important for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s operations and the communities we serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This quarter, we incorporated a lot of learning that took place after our first iteration in Q3 2023.
We are hoping to sharpen up the timing of events throughout the process, including communicating internally and externally about our status (thus, this blog post series).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next quarter, we aim to build off of this work, and to identify where our future new hires of
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager">Delivery Manager / Interim Chief of Staff&lt;/a>
and our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead">Product Lead&lt;/a>

Three New Jobs Posted
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#three-new-jobs-posted">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In October, we began a short hiring push to address many of the organizational challenges noted in
&lt;a href="../organizational-report/">our organizational structure and strategy audit&lt;/a>
.
We aim to have each of these positions filled by the end of the year and begin incorporating new team members into our organization.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of the three job postings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager">Delivery Manager / Interim Chief of Staff&lt;/a>

Product Strategy Work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#product-strategy-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We kicked off a collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://richardpope.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Richard Pope&lt;/a>
to provide us with some short-term product strategy work.
In Q3, our team took stock of the many different kinds of services and technology that we deploy, aiming to refine this into a long-term product model.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Richard will join us for several months to take these outputs and help us craft them into a model for where 2i2c is delivering value that we can build upon for the coming years.
We&amp;rsquo;ll provide more updates for the community as this work continues.&lt;/p>

Continued Onboarding of Communities in Our Catalyst Project Collaboration
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#continued-onboarding-of-communities-in-our-catalyst-project-collaboration">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We continued onboarding communities onto infrastructure managed by 2i2c as part of a
&lt;a href="../../2022/czi-global-communities-announcement/">CZI-funded project to serve communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/a>
.
The grant team began its operations last April and spent the first several months creating an onboarding pipeline and rubric for identifying and connecting with communities.
As of October, we&amp;rsquo;ve onboarded our first few communities - there is still a lot of content, training material, and documentation to create, and we will begin iterating on this in collaboration with our early-adopted communities in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="partnerships-and-impact">
Partnerships and Impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#partnerships-and-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>This section describes notable new partnerships and developments with communities in our interactive computing hub service.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We began several new partnerships with communities in the research space this month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA Visualization, Exploration, and Data Analysis (VEDA)&lt;/a>
project is an open-source science cyberinfrastructure for data processing, visualization, exploration, and geographic information systems (GIS) capabilities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://us-ghg-center.github.io/ghgc-docs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Greenhouse Gas Center&lt;/a>
provides a cloud-based system for exploring and analyzing U.S. government and other curated greenhouse gas datasets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve celebrated considerable growth in one of our partner communities:
&lt;a href="https://cryointhecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryoCloud&lt;/a>
.
This community focuses its work around studying the Cryosphere using satellite imagery data.
They&amp;rsquo;ve grown their community hub to roughly 300 users in a year and have piloted several novel interfaces for data analysis in a JupyterHub context, such as using
&lt;a href="https://qgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QGIS&lt;/a>
via a Linux desktop browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c team members also gave several talks in October, and you can find links to each of these below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;h2 id="what-weve-learned-and-what-stood-out">
What We&amp;rsquo;ve Learned and What Stood Out
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-weve-learned-and-what-stood-out">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>These are things that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in the past month that we&amp;rsquo;re using to improve our service moving forward&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Communities like to define and select their own environments&lt;/strong>.
We began rolling out new functionality to allow communities to &lt;strong>define their user environments on-the-fly&lt;/strong>.
This brings mybinder.org-style environment creation into a JupyterHub, and gives both more control and more visibility into the environments that communities use.
We noticed that this also begins to blur the line between different workflows and types of communities that can be served on a single hub.
It means that a hub is no longer strictly tied to a small number of user environments created for it.
We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the implications of this in the coming months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We need to improve our billing and invoicing infrastructure&lt;/strong>.
This month we began going through another backlog of cloud infrastructure invoices to send out to communities.
For many communities, 2i2c pays a cloud bill on their behalf and passes through costs directly to them.
This allows them to know exactly what they&amp;rsquo;re paying for.
However, it is also starting to generate a lot of work!
We aim to explore ways to automate and standardize this process in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Digital Public Goods is a concept that resonates with many community leaders&lt;/strong>.
Jim and Chris both gave talks that leaned heavily into the notion of open tools and services as &amp;ldquo;Digital Public Goods&amp;rdquo;.
As public goods, it is important that they remain &amp;ldquo;driven by the public&amp;rdquo; and that they have sustainable and scalable models to grow the value that these goods provide.
We&amp;rsquo;ve noted that this topic resonates heavily with people across the research and education spectrum, and we&amp;rsquo;re considering how to lean into these values more heavily in 2i2c.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open organizational report: Strengths and challenges for 2i2c's team</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the last several months 2i2c has been working with an organizational consulting group called
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Difference Digital&lt;/a>
to help us identify the major opportunities and challenges in our organizational structure and strategy.
The result of this work is a report that describes in detail the major strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities that 2i2c faces. It also recommends major actions to take as an organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c values organizational transparency and a willingness to be honest about where you&amp;rsquo;re struggling.
Stress is a natural part of both individuals and organizations, and should be embraced with the goal of learning and improving.
Moreover, as a young organization 2i2c has benefitted heavily from the documents and learning that &lt;em>other&lt;/em> organizations have made publicly available.
We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where we are without building on the backs of others who are willing to share what they&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we are making this organizational audit and report public for anyone to see.
We hope that it provides transparency into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s current status, and that it serves as a useful resource for other non-profits that are growing and facing similar challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10081003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the report on Zenodo&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more background on this report, check out the short description below.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In April of this year we had our first in-person team meeting.
We were excited and grateful to have the opportunity to speak to each other face-to-face.
We also learned that many people on our team were stressed out!
Our service had grown slow-but-steadily over the previous year, and we were feeling the tension that comes with growing your partnerships without significantly changing your team&amp;rsquo;s capacity or structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to work with an organizational consulting group called
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>
to help us identify where we need to make improvements.
They spent several weeks having one-on-one conversations with each member of the team, as well as doing a broader organizational analysis and comparison to other technical organizations at a similar stage of their lifecycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result of this work was a report that outlines the major opportunities and strengths, as well as challenges and gaps in capacity, that our team currently faces.
It makes a number of recommendations for how we should shift our practices, and importantly it also notes that the only way to gain that capacity is by hiring for new people and skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10081003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the report on Zenodo&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The immediate result of this work is that we currently have three jobs posted:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead">A Product Lead role&lt;/a>
to help us build a &amp;ldquo;product function&amp;rdquo; within 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager">A Delivery Manager / Chief of Staff role&lt;/a>
to oversee and manage 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s system of work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/23qq4-open-source-infrastructure-engineer">A cloud and operations engineering role&lt;/a>
to grow our cloud engineering team&amp;rsquo;s capacity in serving communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our next steps are to fill these positions, and to then begin the work of implementing many of the recommendations that are contained in the report.
We&amp;rsquo;re confident that this is a natural part of being a small and growing organization, and we are grateful for the expertise of
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>

In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work serving and growing our interactive computing service, as well as doing some introspection as a team and identifying major next steps moving forward.
More on that in the following sections, but first a short service update.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-has-our-service-evolved-over-the-past-few-months">

&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="new-partnerships-and-service-growth">
New partnerships and service growth
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-partnerships-and-service-growth">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our service has grown several new partner communities over the last two quarters. A few notable communities are
&lt;a href="https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the NASA VEDA project&lt;/a>
, a
&lt;a href="https://smithsonian.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team at the Smithsonian&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://ncar-cisl.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team at NCAR&lt;/a>
, and the
&lt;a href="https://hub.ghg.center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Greenhouse Gases Center&lt;/a>
. We are running about &lt;strong>71 hubs across 24 clusters, with about 4000 weekly users&lt;/strong> (
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/kpis/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more usage stats here&lt;/a>
).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also began operations on a major collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa, called
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7025288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Catalyst Project&lt;/a>
.
This team met together for the first time in April, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been laying a foundation for service growth in the first several months.
We are just onboarding our first communities and hope to grow that service in the coming year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to receive some grants around creating content and designing workflows that utilize cloud infrastructure. For example, a
&lt;a href="https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/open-science-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA TOPS grant&lt;/a>
and an upcoming collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Pythia&lt;/a>
around geospatial workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="financial-picture">
Financial picture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#financial-picture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>recovering roughly 40% of our operating costs&lt;/strong> through recurring fees of our managed hub service (making up the remainder in development contracts and grants), and &lt;strong>we&amp;rsquo;ve currently got around 2 years of runway&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, both of these will be lowered soon because we are about to hire for several more positions.
Improvements to our product model will allow us to estimate and recover our service costs more effectively, but we also intend to raise some funds next year to support our efforts in making our service more robust, sustainable, and valuable to communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to strike a proper balance of team (and cost) growth against the financial buffer needed to assure your partners you&amp;rsquo;ll stick around, but we&amp;rsquo;re confident that the new hires described below will serve critical needs for our team and mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more context on why and how we&amp;rsquo;re trying to make up that capacity, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">
How service growth can lead to team stress
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve had a slow-but-steady stream of new communities interested in working with 2i2c for managing cloud infrastructure for interactive computing.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s make it work somehow&amp;rdquo; approach to all of our community partnerships thus far, with the idea that we must use these partnerships to learn what communities want and identify common patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exciting, and we&amp;rsquo;re fortunate to see the interest and growth in our service.
It suggests to us that something about our model is fundamentally right.
Communities really love the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
, and our participatory service model based around upstream contributions, transparency, and shared responsibility is attractive to many in research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, each new community is also a new set of stresses on the technical and social infrastructure of our team.
Without the capacity to manage the demands of the service, you run the risk of over-extending &amp;ndash; and in a worst case scenario, burning out &amp;ndash; your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This became clear in our first in-person team meeting last May.
At that meeting, we realized that many on the team were spending too much of their time &amp;ldquo;reacting&amp;rdquo; to demands from the service.
We also learned that the scope and complexity of our various workstreams had gotten to a size where our informal team structures of work prioritization were no longer adequate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">
Growing the complexity of our team to match the complexity of our service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, for the past several months we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a plan to evolve 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team structure in order to more effectively manage the complexity of our service, and balance long- and short-term thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This began with an organizational audit carried out by
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>
, a consulting group that focuses on tech-for-good and non-profit products and services.
They conducted interviews with everybody on the team, and concluded that we have a few key functions missing that were creating or compounding the stresses people felt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope to make some of their key findings public soon (Update: this is now available at
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/">this blog post about the organizational report&lt;/a>
), and in the meantime here is an overview of some highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">
We need a dedicated product functionality
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>First, we realized that we have a number of new &amp;ldquo;signals&amp;rdquo; pushing our service in many different directions.
Some are external - from communities we work with or from funders. Some are internal - from different team member visions of where work is needed.
After growing our service and our team, there are now too many perspectives and voices to balance in an unstructured and purely organic way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>dedicated &amp;ldquo;product function&amp;rdquo; within 2i2c&lt;/strong>.
Its goal will be to serve as an integrator across the many stakeholders that are interested in 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s service, and synthesize a collective product strategy and system of prioritization to move the organization forward.
They&amp;rsquo;ll help 2i2c grow a culture of iteration and decisions that are driven by the needs of our community partners and users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring a Product Lead&lt;/a>
to kick off this effort.

We need a more structured system of work and execution
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-more-structured-system-of-work-and-execution">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Next, we realized that there are many different workstreams we must balance simultaneously.
There are new communities to be onboarded, infrastructure bugs to be fixed, questions to be answered, and strategic priorities to improve the service.
Expecting each team member to individually find the right balance between all of these is increasingly unrealistic.
We need capacity to oversee this system of work and bring some structure to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>Delivery Manager role&lt;/strong> to oversee the system of work that our engineering team uses for its planning and execution.
In addition, this role will serve at an organization-wide capacity as an &lt;strong>interim Chief of Staff&lt;/strong>.
This will allow them to improve and standardize practices organization-wide, and coordinate major projects that span our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job posting for a Delivery Manager / interrim Chief of Staff&lt;/a>
role.

We need more capacity to support our team and its individuals
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-capacity-to-support-our-team-and-its-individuals">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to moving forward our workstreams, we also have a unique challenge in team support and dynamics.
2i2c is a small team, it is also distributed across 10 time zones!
This adds a lot of extra challenge in getting the team to communicate with one another, support one another as individuals, and learn and grow as a team.
We believe that it&amp;rsquo;s critical to support one another, and to have systems in 2i2c that recognize these challenges in distributed collaboration to design around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re exploring how to create a &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;People Operations&amp;rdquo; function within 2i2c&lt;/strong> that can dedicate their time to supporting 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team as a group as individuals.
This might mean defining creative ways for team-building, creating mechanisms to surface where team members are struggling or need support, and growing best-practices in inclusive asynchronous team culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of designing this role, and hope to have it out in the coming months!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-more-engineering-capacity">
We need more engineering capacity
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-engineering-capacity">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, we also realized we need more cloud engineering capacity on our team, particularly in a timezone that overlaps with the American continents.
This will give our team a bit more breathing room to balance reactive and project-based work, and have more capacity to focus on personal growth and learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find our

What&amp;rsquo;s up next for our team?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-up-next-for-our-team">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve also adopted a new quarterly planning system to align our team around key goals that deserve focused attention in each quarter.
This will let us be more intentional about considering our work in the context of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s broader opportunities and challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the final quarter of 2023, we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on these key goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Begin to standardize and refine our product offering&lt;/strong>.
In advance of our Product Lead role, we are doing a bit of work to more precisely describe and structure our &lt;em>current&lt;/em> service offering.
Our goal is to lay a foundation that our upcoming Product Lead can then use to learn about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s product and make progress more quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pay down technical debt&lt;/strong>.
Our engineering team is going to focus on streamlining their operations and reducing toil, in order to reduce the number of &amp;ldquo;unexpected distractions&amp;rdquo; that come with inefficient infrastructure and processes.
It will also make the service more reliable and transparent for our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build foundational resources for hub champions to support their community.&lt;/strong>
Our Partnerships team will lead an effort to build basic infrastructure and content that communities can use to create their own knowledge bases around hubs. This will be ongoing work so the goal here is to create a foundation to build upon in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We hope that this has been an informative update from our team, and we appreciate everybody&amp;rsquo;s input and collaboration over the past few months.
We think that the tensions described in this post are healthy - they&amp;rsquo;re reflective of an organization that is growing and reaching organizational milestones.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to tackle them and to continue growing our impact and partnerships.&lt;/p>

As we continue to grow and evolve, it&amp;rsquo;s essential that our branding communicates who we are, what we stand for, and how we envision our future.
We hope that this new design will unify our visual style across the many places where 2i2c operates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In pursuit of these objectives, we teamed up with
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/zacharia-adell-230a3399" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zack Adell&lt;/a>
, a designer based in Nairobi who has worked with several similar projects over the years (having most-recently overhauled the
&lt;a href="https://investinopen.org/blog/introducing-our-new-logo-and-visual-identity/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Invest in Open Infrastructure brand design&lt;/a>

After several rounds of brainstorming, design reviews, and fine-tuning, we&amp;rsquo;ve landed on a visual identity that resonates with our organization.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Color is the first visual thing we remember and a powerful asset in building brand recognition.
Our color is blue.
Our community blue says the sky is not the limit. It&amp;rsquo;s energetic and vibrant, just like the community we serve.
And it&amp;rsquo;s our primary colour, supported by a lively secondary palette that&amp;rsquo;s as at home on digital platforms as it is on billboards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve chosen two fonts to use in the majory of the text that we write.
&lt;code>Poppins&lt;/code> for big, bold sentences, and &lt;code>Work Sans&lt;/code> for more versatile and everyday use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re the strands that intersect and show how our work and values are interconnected to our community.
We like them because they represent 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core mission, which is to build connections between people, computation, and data in order to share open knowledge.
We&amp;rsquo;ll try and think of creative ways to incorporate them into our visual style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe our new visual identity is more than just a fresh coat of paint.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reaffirmation of our commitment to our stakeholders and an exciting milestone in our ongoing journey.

&lt;p>This quarter we grew our engineering team significantly, and started to refine our team processes and structures to accommodate this extra complexity.
We expanded our managed cloud service with new community partners, and made a number of improvements to our technical infrastructure and organizational processes for managing this service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read on below to learn more about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-community-partnerships">
New community partnerships
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-community-partnerships">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We added several new community partnerships to our managed hub service.
We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed new hub infrastructure for each of the following groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our
&lt;a href="https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Toronto Jupyter service&lt;/a>
now has a dedicated R hub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.drakkar-ocean.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drakkar Ocean project&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA Visuaslization Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/quantifiedcarbon/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuantifiedCarbon&lt;/a>
organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://oceanhackweek.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OceanHackWeek 2023&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We onboarded several new community colleges to our &amp;ldquo;JupyterHubs Education in Community Colleges&amp;rdquo; collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://www.cloudbank.org/welcome-cloudbank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudBank&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley CDSS&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="service-improvements">
Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Below are a few highlights for ways in which we improved our
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed Cloud Service&lt;/a>
for our partner communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-simplified-our-authentication-workflow-with-cilogon">
We simplified our authentication workflow with CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-simplified-our-authentication-workflow-with-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Authentication services allow us to identify a user when they log onto a hub, which determines their ability to access hub resources.
Previously we had used a combination of
&lt;a href="https://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auth0&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
, or
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/hub-deployment-guide/configure-auth/github-orgs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub&lt;/a>
for authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with our use of CILogon so far, especially because of its non-profit status and alignment with many research and education institutions that we work with.
This quarter, we decided to streamline our authentication process by dropping the use of Auth0 and grow our partnership with CILogon.&lt;/p>

We exposed user activity dashboards in JupyterHub so communities know how many people are using the service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-exposed-user-activity-dashboards-in-jupyterhub-so-communities-know-how-many-people-are-using-the-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We tend to work with &lt;em>leaders&lt;/em> of communities that utilize our service and infrastructure for many others in their network.
For example, a teacher with a classroom of students, or a researcher with a global network of collaborators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to track how many users are actively using a platform over various metrics of time.
This can tell you whether your community finds a service useful, and whether this is growing or shrinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use
&lt;a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana&lt;/a>
to automatically generate dashboards of activity for all of our community hubs and clusters.
However, tracking &lt;strong>daily, weekly, and monthly active users&lt;/strong> was not part of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s core functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to upstream this functionality into JupyterHub and expose it via
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the JupyterHub Grafana project&lt;/a>
.
All 2i2c hubs now track daily, weekly, and monthly unique active users.
And importantly, anybody else deploying the
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero to JupyterHub for Kubernetes&lt;/a>

We upgraded Kubernetes across all of our AWS clusters

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes&lt;/a>
is at the core of our cloud infrastructure and scalability.
We use either a shared or a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for each of our community partners, and it is the foundation upon which all of their Jupyter infrastructure rests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest challenges with managing an ongoing cloud service is keeping the underlying infrastructure upgraded.
This brings in new stability and functionality, but also often involves manual steps and toil.
This quarter, we upgraded each of our AWS JupyterHubs to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes 1.24&lt;/a>
and will continue this effort with other providers in the coming quarters.&lt;/p>

We streamlined our hub uptime checks to be more efficient
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-streamlined-our-hub-uptime-checks-to-be-more-efficient">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The best kinds of failures are ones that your operations team recognizes and solves before any users run into the problem themselves.
We use the
&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Platform HTTP uptime checker&lt;/a>
to
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/topic/monitoring-alerting/uptime-checks.html#simple-https-uptime-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run regular uptime checks for each of the community hubs that we use&lt;/a>
.
This allows us to get quick alerts if any of our community hubs is down for some reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made several optimizations to this process so that we can more efficiently monitor hub uptime and trigger alerts to our engineering team if action is needed.&lt;/p>

We define

About CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#about-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
is an open source service provider that allows users to log in against over 4000 various identity providers, including campus identity providers. The available identity providers are members of
&lt;a href="https://incommon.org/federation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InCommon&lt;/a>
, a federation of universities and other organizations that provide single sign-on access to various resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cilogon-and-2i2c">
CILogon and 2i2c
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cilogon-and-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For the past year, 2i2c has been successfully using CILogon for more than fifteen of the hubs it manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of the hubs that use it are hubs for communities in education that want to manage their hub access through their own institutional providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With using a tool like CILogon, we allow hub access to be managed both through the communities&amp;rsquo; institutional providers, but also through social providers like GitHub and Google. Because both authentication mechanisms can coexist, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to provide specific credentials for 2i2c staff in order to have access to the hub. This reduces both the burden on institution&amp;rsquo;s IT departments, but also the complexity of a hub deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, as we migrate away from our current Auth0 setup, the number of hubs using CILogon will further increase in the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-setup">
The setup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-setup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The setup that 2i2c uses, is based on two important tools, the CILogon administrative client and the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-cilogon-administrative-client">
The CILogon administrative client
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cilogon-administrative-client">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c administrative client&lt;/a>
provided by CILogon allowed us to automatically manage the CILogon OAuth applications needed for authenticating into the hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For each hub that uses CILogon, we dynamically create an OAuth
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client application&lt;/a>
in CILogon and store the credentials safely, using the script at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/3312f373f0aa59fbc98dc1c8161aa9623b68726b/deployer/cilogon_app.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cilogon_app.py&lt;/a>
. The script can also used for &lt;code>updating&lt;/code> the callback URLs of an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>deleting&lt;/code> a CILogon OAuth application when a hub is removed or changes authentication methods, &lt;code>getting&lt;/code> details about an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>getting all&lt;/code> existing 2i2c CILogon OAuth applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-jupyterhub-cilogonoauthenticator">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For CILogon&amp;rsquo;s integration with JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s authentication workflow, we&amp;rsquo;re using the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/blob/main/oauthenticator/cilogon.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>CILogonOAuthenticator&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
, which is part of the
&lt;a href="https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub OAuthenticator project&lt;/a>
. This is what allows JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers for authentication, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a base for writing other Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this 2i2c integration with the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator some important upstream fixes and enhancements to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>oauthenticator&lt;/code>&lt;/a>
were identified and performed. For example, the

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Thanks to the 2i2c - CILogon partnership, during this past year we were able to integrate CILogon into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and to observe its importance, usefulness and great support for 2i2c and the communities we server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are now happy to announce that the 2i2c - CILogon partnership has been expanded to another year!&lt;/p>

See
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our open source policy documentation&lt;/a>
for the product of this brainstorm.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past year the 2i2c team has focused its efforts on deploying, configuring, running, and managing cloud infrastructure that supports open source workflows in research and education. We&amp;rsquo;ve also done a lot of &lt;em>upstream contribution&lt;/em> as a part of our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we have shied away from taking direct funding for direct development work in open source projects. This is for two primary reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Our focus has been on managing cloud infrastructure, not developing it. We want to facilitate access to open workflows in interactive computing, which is a different skillset and kind of work than &lt;em>creating&lt;/em> those tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While 2i2c is aligned with the interests of open communities, we are still a distinct organization with our own mission and strategy. We want to be conscious that 2i2c team members have &lt;em>more than one hat&lt;/em>, and that their 2i2c hat is necessarily not the same thing as their open source hat. As such, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to leverage our &amp;ldquo;other hats&amp;rdquo; to drive resources to 2i2c without being thoughtful about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In the last year we&amp;rsquo;ve found that running infrastructure for research and education gives us great visibility into the kinds of things that these communities want to do, and ways to improve the infrastructure. It also means we can potentially be a conduit of &lt;em>resources&lt;/em> from those communities into open source development workflows. For example, we recently
&lt;a href="../../2022/gesis-2i2c-collaboration-update/">partnered with GESIS to make improvements in Binder and JupyterHub&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this post is a brainstorm to identify some of the major considerations that we should take before agreeing to this kind of work. Its goals is to drive policy that streamlines our ability to seek and accept funding for open source work. It tries to answer this question:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can a stakeholder accept funding on behalf of an open source community in a way that is inclusive, equitable, and effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="some-assumptions">
Some assumptions
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#some-assumptions">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off I want to note that this only applies to open source projects that I&amp;rsquo;d call &amp;ldquo;Open communities&amp;rdquo;. For example, those that follow
&lt;a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the principles of open scholarly infrastructure&lt;/a>
. The ideas here don&amp;rsquo;t apply to open source projects that are run by single organizations or people. You can assume I&amp;rsquo;m talking about projects that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Have inclusive multi-stakeholder governance and operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Care about having a broad contributor and leadership base, and want to follow best-practices in inclusive and equitable operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Need funding to drive major new efforts, or to sustain pre-existing maintenance and community management work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Why is this important? In short, because open projects should care about good governance, and about building sustainable and diverse multi-stakeholder communities around their operations and strategy. While it&amp;rsquo;s easy to ignore these considerations and just bring in money however you can (open source is perpetually under-funded, after all), it&amp;rsquo;s crucial that we think about how to do so in a way that aligns with the values of open communities, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t simply propagate a &amp;ldquo;rich get richer&amp;rdquo; dynamic. Ultimately, the unique value of open communities is not in the technology they create, but in the &lt;em>way that they create it&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr-an-overview-of-major-considerations">
&lt;code>tl;dr&lt;/code>: An overview of major considerations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#tldr-an-overview-of-major-considerations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After working with several open source projects over the years, there are a few issues that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come up again and again. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary and I&amp;rsquo;ll note each in more detail below.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Governance&lt;/strong>: funding should &lt;em>follow&lt;/em> major decisions, not make them. It should represent the interests of the project rather than those of a single stakeholder or payer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Transparency&lt;/strong>: stakeholders that accept funding should be transparent in their &lt;em>accounting&lt;/em> (the sources of funding, deliverables attached with it, and operational costs), their &lt;em>plans&lt;/em> (the work they plan to do and how they want to do it) and in their &lt;em>strategy&lt;/em> (the reason they&amp;rsquo;re applying for funding in the first place, and how the work fits in with their other operations).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accountability&lt;/strong>: stakeholders that accept funding should be accountable to the open communities that they are supporting. There should be mechanisms for open communities to provide feedback about and influence their operations, ideally in a powerful position like a board seat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equity&lt;/strong>: funding should be shared with others in the project, particularly those that need it or that couldn&amp;rsquo;t get funding on their own. Moreover, people should be paid for their time - if funding requires work from others, they should be compensated somehow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inclusion&lt;/strong>: funding &lt;em>opportunities&lt;/em> should be shared with others in a project, particularly those from historically disadvantaged communities. Stakeholders with funding &amp;ldquo;connections&amp;rdquo; should use them to boost others in the community as &lt;em>partners&lt;/em>, not just as contractors&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is a more in-depth discussion of each below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="governance-funding-should-follow-decisions">
Governance: funding should follow decisions
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#governance-funding-should-follow-decisions">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As a general rule, &lt;strong>funding should not be a decision&lt;/strong>, it should only be fuel that helps &lt;strong>execute a decision that has already been made&lt;/strong> by the community. Moreover, responsibilities attached to funding should only be given to people with the power to actually carry them out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common mistake that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in open communities is when funding &lt;em>creates&lt;/em> an unintended decision on behalf of many others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a new funder shows up with an agenda and offers it to a subset of maintainers. Those maintainers accept, implicitly making a decision to do the bidding of the funder (this could be a grant, a contract, etc). They begin doing the work, and run into resistance from &lt;em>other&lt;/em> maintainers who weren&amp;rsquo;t on-board with these changes in the first place. This creates a stressful situation where one party has legally committed to doing some work, but they may not have the buy-in from others in the community to let it happen. This is particularly problematic when the funding commitment was not advertised publicly to others in the project early on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to ensure that funding is aligned with good governance principles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make it clear who is allowed to accept money for a project&lt;/strong>. First and foremost, projects should be explicit about who is allowed to accept money that involves doing open source work for them (e.g., only steering council members can approve new funding). Moreover, they should define basic policies about how that money can be used (e.g. does the project have a cap on the amount that can be paid to individuals).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tell others about your funding opportunity and get buy-in.&lt;/strong> If a stakeholder wants to take advantage of a funding opportunity, they should first tell others on the team about the opportunity and what they hope to do. This is the bare minimum - give others an opportunity to object to your plan and/or ask for clarifications or modifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make decisions before funding opportunities arise&lt;/strong>. If the community has already agreed that something is a good idea, then it is much simpler if funding simply helps &lt;em>implement&lt;/em> something rather than &lt;em>propose&lt;/em> something new.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="transparency--make-it-easy-for-others-to-see-your-interests-and-operations">
Transparency: make it easy for others to see your interests and operations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#transparency--make-it-easy-for-others-to-see-your-interests-and-operations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Most open projects are community-led, while funding tends to be awarded to one or more stakeholders &lt;em>within&lt;/em> that community. At a minimum, communities should ask stakeholders to provide transparency about why they&amp;rsquo;re looking for funding, what they&amp;rsquo;re agreeing to do, and how they spend the money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transparency is a way of building trust with other stakeholders by being clear about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to. It makes it easier for others to hold you accountable, and makes it easier for others to understand whether your actions are in line with the goals and values of the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Share your budget with the community&lt;/strong>. Money is always a sensitive subject, but communities have a right to know if funding is being spent towards roles and operations that align with their interests. Some communities may also have policies about how much funding can be awarded to an individual person, and making this clear (even if it is in aggregate) helps others understand what you&amp;rsquo;re doing with funds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Declare conflicts of interest&lt;/strong>. We all have multiple hats when working with an open source project (unless we&amp;rsquo;re paid full-time by the project itself). Any participating organization has their own mission, strategy, and interests. Some of these may be aligned with a community, and some may be aligned with a funding opportunity. It&amp;rsquo;s important to declare how these interests align and where they differ, especially as it pertains to power dynamics and how funding is used.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Carry out project planning and execution in public&lt;/strong>. Dedicated staff have more time than normal to decide and act quickly. If they don&amp;rsquo;t leave a paper trail for their work, it becomes difficult for those with less time to remain engaged and follow along. Make sure that you make your intentions, and the results of your actions, easily discoverable by those who do not have the same amount of time as you do to engage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="accountability-allow-others-to-decide-if-youve-done-a-good-job">
Accountability: allow others to decide if you&amp;rsquo;ve done a good job
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#accountability-allow-others-to-decide-if-youve-done-a-good-job">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Accountability is a complement to transparency - you need to show others what you&amp;rsquo;re up to, and let them tell you if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a good job. At a minimum this should happen at the level of the specific funding opportunity, but ideally you should give key community members visibility and agency into your organization&amp;rsquo;s broader strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ask for feedback about your strategic plan and how this funding fits into it&lt;/strong>. Tell a community about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to, and why you think this funding is in both of your interests to receive. Let them know how it fits in with the big picture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Give strategic oversight to community members that work for a different stakeholder&lt;/strong>. Give special attention to at least one community member that does not work for the same organization (for example, by creating an advisory board and briefing them on your progress and planning). This will help a more neutral perspective represent the interests of the community and avoid potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Perform an audit of your work and share it with others&lt;/strong>. Do your best to objectively assess your own progress towards your goals, and whether you believe you&amp;rsquo;ve represented the community&amp;rsquo;s interests in working towards them. Other community members may not have the resources to do this on their own, and you should use your dedicated funding to perform this yourself (while understandably declaring a conflict of interest in assessing your own work).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="equity-share-resources-and-knowledge-with-others">
Equity: share resources and knowledge with others
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#equity-share-resources-and-knowledge-with-others">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Open communities are a vehicle for building collaborations that span countries, economic situations, and use-cases. They are powerful because of their diverse and multi-stakeholder nature. However, they also exist in a society that is deeply inequitable and that perpetuates centers of wealth and power. This means that most open communities will have a subset of stakeholders with connections and resources that are unavailable to others. To ensure that we follow the principles of open culture, it is crucial that we find ways to push against this inequitable system by sharing resources with one another wherever possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, getting funding often means &lt;em>centralizing the ability to act in a small subset of people&lt;/em>. This runs the risk that decision-making (see above) and organizational knowledge become centralized with those individuals. If you&amp;rsquo;re paid full-time to work on an open source project, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you will personally come to understand the codebase better than anybody else just because you have the time to learn it. This can turn into an anti-pattern where those with access to resources have an unfair power advantage in their perspective over the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, running open source projects requires work on &lt;em>both&lt;/em> the creating and the receiving end. You can pay somebody to write a bunch of code, but somebody else still has to review it, lead discussions, and ultimately decide to merge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Share funding with others.&lt;/strong> If your work is going to require reviews and input from others, find a way to compensate them for their time (if they wish). Prioritize sharing resources with orgs from historically marginalized or disadvantaged communities. When dedicated resources are available, use them for these kinds of groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prioritize documentation and knowledge sharing.&lt;/strong> It can be attractive to work on shiny new things, but it is &lt;em>crucial&lt;/em> that you put in the work to share knowledge with others in a community so that your funding doesn&amp;rsquo;t become a source of knowledge and power centralization. Document your planning and work, and use that funding to make extra efforts to share your experience with others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define practices for making changes that require at least two stakeholders&lt;/strong>. This helps ensure that those funded to work on open source cannot overpower others in the community just because of their dedicated time. It also encourages healthier collaboration and communication between stakeholders.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="inclusion-bring-others-along-with-you">
Inclusion: bring others along with you
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#inclusion-bring-others-along-with-you">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A differentiating aspect of open communities is the way in which they &lt;em>share power among stakeholders&lt;/em>. Funding is inherently tied to power, as it gives you the ability to pay people to do things. Moreover, a stakeholder that &lt;em>controls&lt;/em> funding also controls what it is used for. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to simply share funding with others in a project, &lt;em>if that funding comes with strings attached&lt;/em>. It is also important to share opportunities for funding with others, and to build coalitions of equals when pursuing new funding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collaborators should be given agency over what they want to do with funding. They should be part of grant planning, project planning, etc. They should be seen as co-leads in discussion and announcements. Obviously any funding opportunity will come with obligations, but the important thing is who gets to decide what the team commits to in the first place, and how they plan to accomplish their goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Invite others to participate in funding opportunities, especially if they need it&lt;/strong>. If you identify a funding opportunity, tell others about it. Invite them to collaborate with you on a proposal, or encourage them to write their own proposal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Treat other stakeholders as partners, not contractors&lt;/strong>. Treat collaborators as co-equals that have a say in leadership, strategy, and planning. Funding shouldn&amp;rsquo;t solely come in the form of &amp;ldquo;strings attached&amp;rdquo; and contract work. It should center others as collaborators and leads that bring their own ideas to the table.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Find ways to give power to those who historically do not have it&lt;/strong>. Consider the power dynamics of who applies for funding and actively invite participation from those that need it or that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have access to these resources on their own. If you have a personal connection, use it to bring others to the table. If you&amp;rsquo;re at a well-known organization, use it to boost the profile of others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

How do I actually implement any of this?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-actually-implement-any-of-this">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The ideas in this post are principles and goals to strive for. They also touch on very complex subjects, and following them all perfectly is unrealistic given the state of most organizations. The point is not to define a specific roadmap of actions that must be followed, but to note a few major anti-patterns and ways to avoid them. Fundamentally, your goal should be to &lt;strong>build trust with a community&lt;/strong> and to &lt;strong>live up to the community&amp;rsquo;s mission and values&lt;/strong>. Do what you can, and be honest and open with others in your efforts. A little bit of transparency and effort goes a long way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for 2i2c, we hope to use the ideas in this post to define a strategy and set of policies for how to engage with directed funding for open source. We&amp;rsquo;ll share new ideas in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>

This is a brief reflection on this experience, and an attempt to identify our opportunities for impact and growth in 2023.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-major-goals-in-2022">
Our major goals in 2022
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-major-goals-in-2022">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We wrapped up 2021 with two major new changes.
We had just finished
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">moving fiscal sponsors&lt;/a>
and had just finished a prototype of our
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">alpha service offerings&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our biggest challenge in 2022 was to &lt;strong>identify the bottlenecks in this service model&lt;/strong>, and to begin &lt;strong>building the infrastructure to operate and scale it&lt;/strong>.
This included team infrastructure, technical infrastructure, and administrative infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s see what we did to accomplish this goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights-from-2022">
Highlights from 2022
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#highlights-from-2022">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In 2022, we &lt;strong>thoughtfully grew the number of communities we worked with&lt;/strong>, and used this to make iterative improvements in our model.
As a result, we learned some important things and made significant improvements to our service model and infrastructure.
Here are a few highlights.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-grew-the-number-of-our-partner-communities">
We grew the number of our partner communities
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-grew-the-number-of-our-partner-communities">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>As noted above, we needed to grow the number and diversity of communities we worked with to understand where our model needed to change.
At the end of 2022, we now have &lt;strong>43 community partner hubs across 17 clusters&lt;/strong> (and at least one on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud).
This amounts to roughly &lt;strong>~2,500 active users&lt;/strong> each week.
We also ran more dedicated infrastructure for more than &lt;strong>11 workshops and events&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-grew-our-revenue-from-community-partnerships">
We grew our revenue from community partnerships
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-grew-our-revenue-from-community-partnerships">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One of our goals is to reach self-sustainability without requiring grant funding for most of the communities we serve.
In 2022 we built administrative infrastructure to more efficiently recover monthly costs, and were able to bring in funding for our team from community partnerships.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a plot of our monthly non-grant revenue over the last several months:&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-got-grant-funding-to-serve-communities-in-latin-america-and-africa">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We also learned that some partnerships may &lt;em>require&lt;/em> subsidization from a third party, such as historically marginalized communities and those without dedicated resources.
To explore sustainable ways to serve these communities, we applied for and received a new grant to serve communities in Latin America and Africa!

&lt;a href="../../2022/czi-global-communities-announcement/">blog post announcing this grant&lt;/a>

We improved our continuous integration and deployment system
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-improved-our-continuous-integration-and-deployment-system">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our ability to sustainably grow our service requires being able to &lt;em>technically&lt;/em> serve many communities from a relatively small team.
We centralized and standardized configuration and operations of many community hubs in one transparent space for all of our partner communities.
This allowed us to more easily grow the number of communities we served from one repository.

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our goal is to frame each community hub as a partnership with a clear breakdown of responsibility to give communities more agency over the infrastructure and service.
The Shared Responsibility Model provides a framework for assigning responsibility for various tasks with our partner communities.

We defined a formal Incident Response process
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-defined-a-formal-incident-response-process">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Cloud infrastructure inevitably degrades over time, and running ongoing services is largely about quickly responding to issues and resolving them quickly.
To do so, we need clear processes to follow in order to quickly identify and respond to major incidents in the infrastructure.
Our Incident Response process defines formal team roles and alerting mechanisms that are served by
&lt;a href="https://www.pagerduty.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PagerDuty&lt;/a>
, following best-practices in industry.
This will make our service more reliable and make our processes more transparent for our partner communities.

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-expanded-our-service-offerings-to-include-community-and-workflow-guidance">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We recognized that many communities need more than just infrastructure running in the cloud - they will also benefit from usecase and community guidance.
We&amp;rsquo;re exploring a new range of roles that we could fill, starting with hiring a new team member to help us lead these efforts.

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This marks our first efforts into &lt;em>development-focused work&lt;/em> as opposed to operating cloud infrastructure.
We will use this experience to learn how to pair focused development with cloud operations (more on that below).
It will also make it more likely that we can implement often-requested improvements to the JupyterHub / BinderHub ecosystems.

These spanned technical improvements as well as organizational and community efforts.

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, the experience from this year gave us a lot to think about regarding our role and potential for impact in the research and education ecosystem and the open source community.
We
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/strategic-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated our strategy&lt;/a>
in order to focus on a more holistic and collaborative approach to the work with our partner communities.
We&amp;rsquo;ll continue to refine this strategy moving forward.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re excited about all of the progress we made in 2022, and to continue that progress in 2023.
Here are a few areas where we wish to focus our efforts as we begin the new year to keep this momentum going.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="sharpen-our-shared-responsibility-model">
Sharpen our Shared Responsibility Model
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#sharpen-our-shared-responsibility-model">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our Shared Responsibility Model is in a kind of &amp;ldquo;alpha&amp;rdquo; phase right now. We have some of the high-level skeleton there, but there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of detail to fill in. Thus far, communities have really liked the idea but we need to make it clearer how we break-down specific jobs and how to decide when to give more or less responsibility to another community.
We&amp;rsquo;d also like to define more intersection points with our partner communities at the level of strategic and service planning so that our communities have a say in our vision and strategic plan.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="grow-our-community-support-operations">
Grow our community support operations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#grow-our-community-support-operations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun exploring how to support communities in their &lt;em>usage&lt;/em> of cloud infrastructure, but still have a long way to go to understand what role we should play here.
For example, how can we assist communities in cloud workflows without becoming domain experts ourselves?
How can we guide communities in a sustainable and scalable way?
How can we recover the costs of doing this work?
We hope to use our experiences in
&lt;a href="../../2022/czi-global-communities-announcement/">our upcoming project to serve communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/a>
to explore these questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="define-a-cost-recovery-model-that-balances-sustainability-and-accessibility">
Define a cost recovery model that balances sustainability and accessibility
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#define-a-cost-recovery-model-that-balances-sustainability-and-accessibility">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our current cost recovery model is intentionally very simple - we charge a fixed monthly cost for human time, and pass-through cloud costs directly.
We charge a bit more for more complex deployments and use-cases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that this is both too expensive for simple deployments, and too cheap for really complex deployments.
It&amp;rsquo;s also inaccessible to organizations that do not have the resources to pay, which correlates heavily with historically marginalized communities.
We&amp;rsquo;ll need to refine this model to be both scalable and sustainable, but also accessible to the variety of communities we want to serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="incorporate-a-dedicated-software-development-practice-that-aligns-with-open-values">
Incorporate a dedicated software development practice that aligns with open values
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#incorporate-a-dedicated-software-development-practice-that-aligns-with-open-values">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In 2022 we learned that our position in &lt;em>running&lt;/em> infrastructure in the cloud gives us visibility into the ways that researchers and educators want open source tools to be &lt;em>improved&lt;/em>.
In some cases our partner organizations are also willing to contribute resources to help make this happen, or we can identify third parties to fund development work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thus far we have focused our efforts on &lt;em>deploying and managing&lt;/em> cloud infrastructure.
We do make improvements to software as a part of this, but there&amp;rsquo;s a big difference between running a cloud service and making significant &lt;em>enhancements&lt;/em> to software.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to use our position to help funnel more resources into open source development, but there are a few tricky things to figure out.
For example: How can we accept funding to do open source work in a way that doesn&amp;rsquo;t effectively make us sole decision-makers or gatekeepers for doing development? How can we incorporate software development team practices into a team that has thus-far focused on operating cloud infrastructure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Thanks for reading this update about our work in 2022.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited about what we&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished thus far, as well how we hope to expand our impact in the near future.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our goal is to create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service that enables community-based cloud-native workflows in the biosciences. We will promote values of open and inclusive community practices, infrastructure that enables these practices, and a “train the trainers” approach that empowers community leaders to share expertise in cloud infrastructure with others in their communities. Our focus will be on communities in Latin America and Africa, and we hope to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities that are historically marginalized from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will be providing cloud infrastructure operation and support for the communities that we partner with in this effort.
We will also assist with creating content to teach cloud-native workflows and assist community leaders in learning this content so that they can share these skills with others.&lt;/p>

enables researchers across the world to replicate computational environments in the cloud. It allows researchers to turn static code into interactive literate coding environments with a click of a button within seconds. The
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mybinder.org&lt;/a>
service is powered by
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub&lt;/a>
, an open-source tool developed by
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Jupyter Project&lt;/a>
that many organizations have deployed for their own communities. It does this by _dynamically building _the software environment needed to reproduce a computation (using a tool called
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
), and making this environment available to users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BinderHub was developed for use-cases that are &lt;em>temporary&lt;/em> and &lt;em>fully open&lt;/em> by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past several years, the
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GESIS Notebooks&lt;/a>
team made the first steps towards bridging this gap through their
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persistent BinderHub&lt;/a>
implementation. This was a modified and authenticated BinderHub that &lt;em>included&lt;/em> persistent storage across sessions. The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFDI4DS&lt;/a>
(GAN: 460234259),
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CESSDA&lt;/a>
, and members of the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMTE&lt;/a>
project. This collaboration has three primary goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generalize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure&lt;/strong>, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects&lt;/strong>, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub&lt;/strong>, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See
&lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this GitHub Projects Board for issues that implement this effort&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">
Exploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the
&lt;a href="http://binderhub.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>
. We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persistent BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>
. The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modified Helm Chart&lt;/a>
that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality &lt;em>natively&lt;/em> into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to take another approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">
Exploration 2: Add dynamic image building to JupyterHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, &lt;strong>we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using
&lt;a href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a>
project that
&lt;a href="https://quantstack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuantStack&lt;/a>
had built for the
&lt;a href="https://plasmabio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlasmaBio project&lt;/a>
. This implementation was seen as successful, and something others in the community had wanted to generalize for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="our-implementation-plan">
Our implementation plan
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-implementation-plan">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="two-phases-of-implementation">
Two phases of implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#two-phases-of-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a back-end for dynamic environment building&lt;/strong>. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and is easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are a few tasks that we’re carrying out next to make progress on the above two items.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a working prototype for image generation via a &lt;em>JupyterHub Service&lt;/em> (see below for current status)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research the &lt;code>tljh-repo2docker&lt;/code> code base to understand how we could build upon its UX and functionality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the typical process that GESIS and NFDI users follow in their BinderHub workflows, to ensure that it can be replicated via this new implementation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform UI/UX research validation to inform the implementation from a user’s perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a follow-up, we’ll likely re-work the BinderHub codebase to utilize JupyterHub’s new repo2docker service, rather than defining its own custom repo2docker functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">
Back-end implementation as a JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We’re planning to use
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub Services&lt;/a>
to add the back-end functionality for dynamic image building to a JupyterHub. Services are a way to expose functionality via a JupyterHub REST API, and would allow us to expose basic image generation on-the-fly with
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
. We aim for basic functionality to be as close as possible to repo2docker’s default behavior, but to make this functionality _composable and customizable _if a JupyterHub administrator wants to provide different out-of-the-box functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While details may still change, we believe that the major architectural plan has now been settled. We have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an experimental codebase&lt;/a>
with a basic implementation of the repo2docker service described above. As part of this effort, this team has also made a number of improvements to repo2docker’s codebase and project infrastructure. We hope that this effort will continue to push resources and attention to repo2docker by growing the number of users and stakeholders that rely on the project for their success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">
Front-end implementation that uses this service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once the back-end setup exists, we can use it to begin prototyping user interactions that can trigger and use repo2docker’s image generation. Bringing dynamic environment image building into JupyterHub is a significant improvement in its functionality, and may introduce new kinds of workflows that we hadn’t initially imagined. Understanding, interpreting, and extending the original “Persistent BinderHub” workflow will require a more thorough understanding of user stories and needs in order to identify new workflows that feel natural not only in a JupyterHub scenario but also in a Binder-like scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here are a few major UI/UX questions we must answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When a user builds an image, should it also become available to &lt;em>other users&lt;/em> as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can a user store, find, and delete old images that they’ve built?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about new versions of the same image?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should we simply mimic the mybinder.org UX, or should this be improved as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We must answer these and several other questions next. With that vision in place, we’d like to &lt;strong>expand our efforts in UI/UX and user research&lt;/strong>. This will help inform the technical implementation of this work as we expand on our prototype, and help us choose the right way to expose this functionality to users. We welcome collaboration around this work - if you know of an organization that is interested in collaboration, please reach out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a few months working on this project, we are even more excited about the potential for dynamically building environments in a JupyterHub. We believe that it adds a new class of workflows to JupyterHubs that were not possible before, and will be immediately useful to the hundreds of communities that deploy JupyterHub for their communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Grant progress report: CZI Foundational grant year 2</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>We recently completed a progress report for Year 2 of our primary CZI funding grant.

Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We made a number of improvements to our cloud infrastructure and the processes around our service.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief breakdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We expanded our shared clusters to new cloud providers and regions&lt;/strong>. We now have shared clusters already deployed on Google Cloud Platform on &lt;code>us-central1-b&lt;/code> and &lt;code>europe-west2&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We defined an incident commander process&lt;/strong>. This will allow us to coordinate and respond to major outages in our cloud infrastructure more efficiently. See
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/projects/managed-hubs/incidents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our incident response documentation&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We improved our cloud usage monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a centralized Grafana Dashboard&lt;/a>
that aggregates cloud usage across all of our partner communities, and allows us to keep track of any unexpected behavior or outages across them all.&lt;/p>

Where we&amp;rsquo;re focusing next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#where-were-focusing-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the final quarter of this year, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus our efforts on &lt;strong>growing capacity&lt;/strong> across all of the aspects of our team.
Now that we have brought on several more partner communities into our Managed JupyterHub Service, it has shown us where we have bottlenecks in our technology, process, and structure.
In 2023 we hope to significantly grow the number of communities we work with, and so we must grow our capacity to be able to take on these new partnerships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aim to accomplish this in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make technical improvements&lt;/strong> to our cloud infrastructure that reduces the amount of human labor associated with regular actions. This will make our cloud infrastructure more scalable and reliable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and partnership leads pipeline&lt;/strong> so that we can reduce the amount of administrative toil for ourselves and for the communities we work with in billing and cloud cost pass-through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Refine our organizational strategy and structure&lt;/strong> so that we are better-able to agree on our most important objectives, and to execute on them efficiently as a distributed team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hire people!&lt;/strong> While improving our efficiency will certainly grow our capacity, we also hope to grow our capacity the old fashioned way: by hiring more team members. We&amp;rsquo;re identifying the biggest needs on our team now and will hope to have postings soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/li>

It is a brainstorm from the Executive Director, shared as a blog post to invite feedback and provide transparency into our current thinking. Its goal is to explore the context of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s stakeholders and their needs, and identify an opportunity and plan for having a positive impact with these communities. It is not a concrete proposal but a snapshot of thinking in time meant to trigger reflection. Over time we will incorporate some of these ideas
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">into our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When we founded 2i2c, we largely did so from the &amp;ldquo;bottom up&amp;rdquo; - we identified several patterns around hosted infrastructure that were useful at
&lt;a href="https://datahub.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>
, and similar communities, and we wished to make them more generalized, accessible, and scalable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We defined our mission as the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Our mission is to make research and education more impactful, accessible, and delightful by developing, operating, and supporting infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>And a description about our immediate activities to make things a bit more concrete:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>2i2c designs, develops, and operates JupyterHubs in the cloud for communities of practice in research &amp;amp; education. It builds and supports open source infrastructure that serves these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Around a year ago
&lt;a href="http://2i2c.org/blog/2021/six-month-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we began our pilot JupyterHubs project&lt;/a>
to learn more about our biggest challenges and opportunities in making interactive computing more accessible and useful for research and education.
While both of these statements are still accurate, over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned more about the value that 2i2c provides. This post is an exploration of how these statements and our strategy may evolve in the near future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-did-we-miss-with-our-original-strategy">
What did we miss with our original strategy?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-did-we-miss-with-our-original-strategy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In short: it is too-focused on &lt;strong>actions&lt;/strong> rather than &lt;strong>impact&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While running JupyterHubs is a key part of what 2i2c does, it is a means to an end rather than our end-goal.
Infrastructure is only useful if it changes workflows in a way that aligns with the goals and values that we wish to achieve.
We&amp;rsquo;ve historically defined these in a few scattered places. For example, here are the values listed on our website:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>2i2c values fairness and justice as requirements for successful communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2i2c values learning and discovery for all people.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2i2c values collaborating and connecting to foster environments for learning and discovery.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>However, it is difficult to tie our operations directly to values and goals without making them concrete, and without defining a plan that ties them to our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Through our JupyterHubs pilot, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned how our actions-focused approach was missing some important aspects of these broader goals.
For example, we came to understand that a big part of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s value isn&amp;rsquo;t just providing a JupyterHub, it is &lt;em>de-risking cloud native workflows&lt;/em> for communities that are inherently skeptical of what cloud infrastructure offers.
Doing this entails many things: teaching, making decisions on behalf of others, supporting and answering questions, building trust, and yes, managing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="refining-our-strategy">
Refining our strategy
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#refining-our-strategy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>With this in mind, we&amp;rsquo;d like to &lt;strong>make our strategy more clearly-defined and tied to our operational choices&lt;/strong>. Here are a few ways we&amp;rsquo;d like to do this:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Define our organization&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong>values and vision&lt;/strong> for the impact we wish to have.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define the key &lt;strong>stakeholder communities&lt;/strong> that we wish to serve, the context of tools and services that are relevant to these stakeholders, and the assumptions we&amp;rsquo;re making.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define the &lt;strong>problems these stakeholders have&lt;/strong>, the ways in which their current workflow could be improved, and the opportunity to help them.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Describe our &lt;strong>strategy&lt;/strong> to positively impact these stakeholders with our work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define a collection of &lt;strong>goals and objectives&lt;/strong> to carry out this strategy in the near-term.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>The rest of this post will take a crack at answering a few of these questions. It is intentionally messy, and meant both as a public snapshot of my thinking at this moment, and fodder for discussion and more specific proposals in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="context-our-key-stakeholders-and-the-impact-we-wish-to-have">
Context: Our key stakeholders and the impact we wish to have
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#context-our-key-stakeholders-and-the-impact-we-wish-to-have">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s key stakeholders are communities of practice that are dedicated to creating and sharing public knowledge.
These are primarily made up of &lt;strong>researchers&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>educators&lt;/strong> in the global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For these stakeholders, we wish to catalyze and support a transformation in their data workflows that allows them to be more collaborative, inclusive, efficient, and powerful in the impact they wish to have.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="assumptions-we-make-about-our-stakeholders">
Assumptions we make about our stakeholders
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#assumptions-we-make-about-our-stakeholders">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There are a few unique things about these communities that are important for us:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Researchers and educators see their job as &lt;strong>creating and sharing knowledge with a heterogeneous and global community&lt;/strong>. They can&amp;rsquo;t make many assumptions about the organizational context or resources of this community, or their work will become inaccessible to others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They &lt;strong>work at vertically-oriented institutions&lt;/strong> (e.g., a university with an in-house IT department), but their communities are &lt;strong>organized horizontally across institutions&lt;/strong> (a researcher may identify more with colleagues in their field than with their co-workers at the university).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>As a result, these communities &lt;strong>value workflows that are maximally accessible, portable, modular, simple, and long-lasting&lt;/strong>. This allows them to define a shared set of practices across their institutional boundaries without requiring a lot of vertical decision-making.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Historically, this means that scientists must choose between workflows that are underpowered but accessible (e.g., collapsed into a PDF describing the work), or powerful but inaccessible to many (e.g., they rely on extensive training or resources only accessible to some institutions).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="open-source-tools-have-boosted-standardization-and-collaboration-across-communities">
Open source tools have boosted standardization and collaboration across communities
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-tools-have-boosted-standardization-and-collaboration-across-communities">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over the past ten years, the proliferation of open source tools has vastly expanded our potential to create public knowledge in a more accessible, modular, inclusive, and productive way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, core numerical computing infrastructure like
&lt;a href="https://numpy.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NumPy&lt;/a>
provides a foundation for more domain specific numerical libraries to build on. Tools like
&lt;a href="https://pandas.pydata.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pandas&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://xarray.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">XArray&lt;/a>
allow for more sophisticated data structures that match the complex and heterogeneous data in the research community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This has led to many domain-specific communities of practice building upon the same APIs and infrastructure to solve their specific needs. By largely sharing the same stack, we have reduced duplication of effort and make it easier to speak the same language across data-rich fields.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="but-a-local-workflow-with-open-source-tools-is-inaccessible-or-underpowered-for-many-people">
&amp;hellip;but a local workflow with open source tools is inaccessible or underpowered for many people
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#but-a-local-workflow-with-open-source-tools-is-inaccessible-or-underpowered-for-many-people">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>However, this has also led to a few key problems:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 1: The ecosystem of open source tools is huge and complex, and hard to tailor for specific domain workflows&lt;/strong>. It is hard to decide which tools to use for a workflow, and we do not have efficient community processes for creating and standardizing workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 2: For many users, it is still too difficult to set up a local environment&lt;/strong>. Installing the right libraries and their dependencies is complex and domain-specific. This leads to wasted time and confusion, especially for newcomers or learners in an educational context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, there is another workflow-related problem that arises even when you do set up a proper environment:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 3: Local workflows are not scalable enough for many communities&lt;/strong>. Working with 10GB of data can be challenging in a local context, working with 10TB of data quickly becomes impossible. This leads to communities that &amp;ldquo;share data&amp;rdquo; by making lots of local copies that are distributed to individual users. This harms data provenance and makes our work less reproducible and accessible. It limits the scope of questions we can ask with data and increases the friction for sharing our work with others. As our workflows require more computation and data, a &amp;ldquo;local, fixed hardware&amp;rdquo; approach will become more and more underpowered.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managed-cloud-services-can-solve-the-accessibility-problem-for-many-workflows-and-tools">
Managed cloud services can solve the accessibility problem for many workflows and tools
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-cloud-services-can-solve-the-accessibility-problem-for-many-workflows-and-tools">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One way to resolve these problems is to rely on &lt;strong>managed infrastructure services&lt;/strong> to provide the environments needed for data analysis. A systems administrator can set up computing and data resources, and then expose these resources to many users as a service. This makes these complex and powerful environments more accessible, standardizes the workflows of users to make it easier for them to collaborate, and potentially serves as a gateway to more complex data and computing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Historically, this work was done in-house by internal teams at research institutions. This led to many unique infrastructure setups with slight differences across institutions. It also led to data and workflows being institution-centric, even though many communities are organized &lt;em>across&lt;/em> institutions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure can solve this problem&lt;/strong>. It provides a layer of infrastructure that can be used to standardize access and worfklows across communities of practice. It can be more accessible than on-prem infrastructure, as the cloud is already globally distributed in a way that local hardware can never be. Moreover, cloud infrastructure is also much more scalable, and can be used to access more sophisticated data and computing resources in a fluid manner.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="but-the-cloud-services-landscape-is-not-designed-for-research-and-education-communities">
But the cloud services landscape is not designed for research and education communities
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#but-the-cloud-services-landscape-is-not-designed-for-research-and-education-communities">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over the last 10 years, a huge ecosystem of cloud-native tools and services have grown to solve this problem in industry. These are often called the
&lt;a href="https://future.com/emerging-architectures-modern-data-infrastructure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Modern Data Stack&lt;/a>
. However, &lt;strong>modern cloud services are largely unused by research and education&lt;/strong>. Why is this?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe it is because most cloud services do not meet many needs of research and educational communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They tend to be offered by a single vendor, which results in a fear of lock-in or vendor-specific workflows that result in high-costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They require users to learn non-standard workflows that are attached to the cloud service.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They often require extensive knowledge of data and cloud resources to configure properly. They may require an internal dev-ops team to integrate cloud services and expose them for internal teams.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They are often still institution-centric because cloud services are geared towards enterprise contracts within vertically-integrated organizations. Many research organizations are more like collections of little fiefdoms rather than a single kingdom.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In short, &lt;strong>many cloud services ask researchers and educators to give up too much agency and choice, and make them reliant on organizations they do not inherently trust&lt;/strong>. They are perceived as a risky alternative to the &amp;ldquo;we have control and have visibility into everything&amp;rdquo; nature of on-prem hardware.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="examples-of-a-potential-model-for-community-centric-cloud-services">
Examples of a potential model for community-centric cloud services
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#examples-of-a-potential-model-for-community-centric-cloud-services">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Over the past several years we have seen several communities strike a balance that made cloud infrastructure more accessible while still retaining agency for the communities of practice that used and managed the infrastructure.
For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Pangeo Project&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud-native geospatial analytics platform&lt;/a>
that builds on the Dask, Zarr, and XArray stack to enable distributed and collaborative access to large-scale geospatial datasets.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://docs.datahub.berkeley.edu/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cloud-native educational community&lt;/a>
that uses a managed service to provide interactive learning environments to thousands of students via the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>The Syzygy service&lt;/strong> is a
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">federated network of educational hubs&lt;/a>
that run entirely on open source infrastructure in the cloud, managed for universities in Canada.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Each of these communities roughly followed the same model:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integrate&lt;/strong> a collection of open source tools and cloud services into a standardized cloud environment for a community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Customize&lt;/strong> the environment and cloud resources via open source tools that provide remote interactive computing sessions. This is usually done with
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Contribute&lt;/strong> to upstream tools and redeploy improvements to a community&amp;rsquo;s shared infrastucture in order to enhance the service.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Moreover, they use nearly identical technical stacks: some combination of Jupyter infrastructure to manage cloud infrastructure and provide interactive computing environments, a Scientific Python or R-based stack for the libraries users access, and a collection of online services to facilitate collaboration and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These services required a combination of &lt;strong>dev-ops and cloud engineering&lt;/strong> skills to integrate the tools and manage the infrastructure, as well as &lt;strong>community guidance and teaching&lt;/strong> to standardize and share workflows across a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So why couldn&amp;rsquo;t this model just be repeated across many other communities as well?&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="however-running-your-own-cloud-infrastructure-is-a-lot-of-work">
However, running your own cloud infrastructure is a lot of work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#however-running-your-own-cloud-infrastructure-is-a-lot-of-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>These initiatives demonstrate the potential of building community-centric cloud services on top of open source tools, but they were also unscalable to other communities. Observing these success stories also reveals a few more problems that we must resolve in order to make these services more generalizable and accessible to new communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 4: Running your own cloud requires skills and resources that most organizations do not have&lt;/strong>. In order to make the most of the cloud and to provide it as a resource reliable-enough for important workflows, it is important to have a knowledgeable team with best-practices in distributed cloud management. However, hiring engineers in this space is very difficult, and the team structure and culture needed for these services is often at-odds with the way universities are structured.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 5: Contributing to open source communities requires dedicated time and skills&lt;/strong>. When building services on top of open source tools, you will invariably need to improve the tools in order to fix bugs or to enhance your service. Doing this is very different from a contract with a traditional vendor, and requires building skills in how to communicate and interact with open source communities. For key open source infrastructure, it also requires an ongoing investment of time into upstream community work that is hard for many institutions to justify.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 6: When institutions run their own clouds, they tend to re-invent institution-centric anti-patterns.&lt;/strong> For example, an institution might expose a cloud-based service but make it available only to individuals with an institutional account.
They might staff it with an under-resourced team (or just a single person). They might make small decisions that differ from institution to institution. All of this limits the effectiveness of the cloud for facilitating collaboration and sharing within communities of practice.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, while vendor-specific cloud services often come with a lot of training material, self-managed cloud services require institutions to build their own practices and guidance for how to use the infrastructure. This results in another major problem:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Problem 7: Communities need assistance in understanding what is possible with cloud-native workflows, and adapting these workflows to their domains.&lt;/strong> There is enormous value in integrating tools together and exposing them as a highly-accessible managed service via the cloud. However, most communities of practice are still new to cloud-native workflows, and they need considerable guidance to begin sharing their practices within a community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are several major problems that we must overcome in order to make cloud infrastructure more accessible and useful to research and education communities while living up to our values of community agency and open workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-opportunity-for-impact">
Our opportunity for impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-opportunity-for-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>To summarize, we believe that there is the following opportunity for impact:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Make communities in research and education do work that is more collaborative, reproducible, and impactful&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In a way that gives them agency and flexibility to do their work as they wish&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>By integrating open tools and standards, managing them as a service with scalable cloud infrastructure, and guiding communities in deciding how to use these tools for their domain-specific problems&amp;hellip;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We believe that the best way to do this is via a mission-aligned non-profit service that is based on values of trust, shared responsibility, and transparency. This will allow us to treat our relationships with communities as &lt;strong>collaborators, not customers&lt;/strong> and share responsibility and agency with them. In this way we can act as a vehicle for &lt;strong>sharing resources and ideas across communities&lt;/strong> via our infrastructure and services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can make such a service both &lt;strong>sustainable&lt;/strong> and &lt;strong>scalable&lt;/strong> because we are delivering direct value to communities with resources. There are many
&lt;a href="https://www.ffwd.org/playbook/choose-a-business-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">potential business models&lt;/a>
that are already in existence (for example, &lt;em>Software as a Service&lt;/em> or shared research infrastructure services like supercomputing centers). By generating resources in exchange for these services, we can &lt;strong>centralize cloud infrastructure services for many communities into a single, scalable team&lt;/strong>. By committing ourselves to an &lt;em>upstream-first service model&lt;/em>, we can &lt;strong>drive resources towards open source communities&lt;/strong> and make these tools more useful for our key stakeholders.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A model like this naturally sets up a two-directional virtuous cycle where open source communities and public knowledge communities derive value from one another&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p>

How should 2i2c try to achieve this impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-should-2i2c-try-to-achieve-this-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>With this in mind, we hope to focus our organizational efforts around building services that focus on the following actions.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Integrate&lt;/strong> open source tools and services into a cloud-native service that is optimized for scientific workflows and communities. The end-product should not feel like &amp;ldquo;a 2i2c product&amp;rdquo; but a service anybody with enough skills could build themselves.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Manage&lt;/strong> cloud infrastructure with an &amp;ldquo;upstream first&amp;rdquo; mentality to provide a high-quality and accessible service for global communities. This will allow communities to focus on their work instead of the infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support&lt;/strong> the communities that use this infrastructure so that questions and problems are dealt with quickly. This will de-risk the service (and the cloud more generally) with the knowledge that help is available.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Guide&lt;/strong> communities in using these tools to do their work more effectively and collaboratively. This will speed up the learning and sharing process so that communities are able to make the most of the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collaborate&lt;/strong> with these communities and embody the values we want to see in the research community to build trust and lead others. This will build trust and strengthen relationships between our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Over time, we may add new verbs (such as &lt;strong>develop&lt;/strong> open source software and &lt;strong>lead&lt;/strong> open source communities), but the ones above define our initial organizational focus.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-most-important-actions-to-take">
Our most important actions to take
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-most-important-actions-to-take">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Accomplishing this requires blending aspects of cloud infrastructure management, domain and workflow expertise, and collaborative service design. As we move forward, these are the biggest challenges to overcome in developing this service further:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a top-notch global Site Reliability Engineering Team&lt;/strong>. First and foremost, the infrastructure that we manage must be reliable and scalable. If you ask communities to do their work in the cloud, they must be confident that it will be stable and highly available. If you wish to serve a global community, then you must build systems management capacity on a global level. This means investing heavily in our asynchronous coordination and communication processes, and building team skills in the modern cloud infrastructure stack and dev-ops practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build centralized cloud deployment infrastructure for community-first services&lt;/strong>. We need the ability to centrally manage infrastructure that is delivered in a community-specific manner to many different communities of practice. This will allow us to achieve economies of scale in managing and running the infrastructure, while allowing communities to have agency over their tools to customize them for their needs. To do this we&amp;rsquo;ll need to use open source tools and cloud services that are designed for flexibility and modularity, create out-of-the-box infrastructure that gets communities 80% of the way there, and gives them the power to define the last 20% in a way that is sustainable for both them and our team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define two or three scientific workflows to focus on, and integrate the right tools and services into a distribution for each&lt;/strong>. We must identify a few scientific workflows to focus on, as well as the infrastructure stack that will be most-useful to the communities that require these workflows. We must integrate this infrastructure into a distribution that any community could pick up, but that has enough flexibility for each to solve their &amp;ldquo;last-mile problem&amp;rdquo; with customizations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define a support and guidance model for community-first services&lt;/strong>. Our support and guidance similarly needs to be generic enough to be scalable to many kinds of communities, but with the ability for communities to make their own customizations and have agency over their training and content. In this way we can be a centralized resource that communities can use to grow their own practice of cloud-native workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify a collaborative service delivery model that doesn&amp;rsquo;t create too much overhead&lt;/strong>. We believe that community-centric infrastructure should be transparent and participatory, and provide agency to communities in shaping their service. On the other hand, we wish to serve many different communities, and thus we must minimize the amount of labor associated with serving any particular community. As a result we must build a collaborative model of roles and expectations around our services that balances participation from community representatives against our ability to act quickly to ensure the best service possible.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Identify a cost-recovery model that is globally accessible and scalable&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve a large and global collection of communities with our services, and so we must identify a way to recover our costs such that we are not restricted to serving only the wealthiest communities in the world, and such that &amp;ldquo;cost vs. resources generated&amp;rdquo; gives us the flexibility to grow to serve a large global community.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an upstream-first culture&lt;/strong>. If we wish to leverage open source tools in our work, we need to build team expertise in interacting with open source communities, deploying their technology in our services, and making improvements to our service by upstream contributions to open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an organizational culture that embodies the values we want to support&lt;/strong>. In order to build a better, more collaborative, more inclusive network of communities of practice, we need to embody the principles we wish to help grow in other communities. This will help us build trust with organizations that are inherently skeptical of &amp;ldquo;outsourcing&amp;rdquo; responsibilities to other organizations, and will make us more effective advocates for the same kinds of practices in other communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>There are many other issues we must tackle, but we&amp;rsquo;ve identified these as being crucial to 2i2c accomplishing its mission. Over the coming months we will continue to refine our practices and service model. As we learn more, we&amp;rsquo;ll update our understanding of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s situation and potential for impact, and our strategy for accomplishing our mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this framing helps others understand our position relative to the communities we wish to serve, and the impact we wish to have. We welcome any feedback or suggestions about how we can refine these ideas to better-serve our communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="appendix-future-growth">
Appendix: Future growth
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#appendix-future-growth">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Many people also ask what the growth model looks like for 2i2c.
Our pricing strategy above should include our goal of &lt;strong>building a financial buffer&lt;/strong> in order to boost the financial resiliency of the organization, and to provide us room to grow if there is an opportunity to expand our service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While we want to focus our efforts on the strategic goals described above, here is how I think 2i2c could grow its operations and expand its impact as a next step.
These are initiatives for which we might seek grant funding to experiment with sustainable and scalable models.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create a software development team&lt;/strong>. Right now our technical efforts are focused on &lt;em>integrating&lt;/em> pre-existing tools and services, and &lt;em>managing&lt;/em> these services in the cloud. However there are many opportunities to &lt;em>create&lt;/em> and &lt;em>enhance&lt;/em> the ecosystem of tools that is out there. Doing dedicated software development is very different from Site Reliability Engineering, and we will need to build our financial and staffing capacity to dedicate team members to this work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Expand the kinds of cloud services we offer&lt;/strong>. Currently we focus our efforts around providing &lt;em>research and analysis platforms&lt;/em> in the cloud. These are often connected to other cloud resources (like datasets) but we do not manage them ourselves. We believe there&amp;rsquo;s an opportunity to strategically grow the services we provide - most notably in the area of cloud data management and migration. However, this is beyond our current capacity and we will need to grow more before moving in this direction.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create an open source support operation&lt;/strong>. There are many things that open source communities need beyond technical improvements. Providing community, operational, and strategic support is another way that 2i2c could use its resources and experience to benefit open source communities that we work with. However, we need to better-understand how to do this in a way that is sustainable for us, and that respects open source communities as independent organizations with their own mission, strategy, and expectations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create a cloud infrastructure training operation&lt;/strong>. Many communities we work with &lt;em>aspire to run their own cloud infrastructure&lt;/em>. They wish to work with a trusted partner like 2i2c in the short-term, but in the long term they want to build their own capacity in running similar services. 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s cloud services are a unique opportunity for others to get hands-on training to grow their skills. Perhaps there is a way for us to share this experience with members from other communities in a way that they can then bring back with them to other organizations. There will be an inherent tension between this and our sustainability model from ongoing services, but we believe it is an important opportunity to explore since it aligns with our values of community agency and choice.&lt;/li>

Problem statement
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#problem-statement">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cloud infrastructure is a powerful way to broaden access to workflows and infrastructure across the globe.
However, it is also inaccessible to many for a variety of reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a large, diverse, and messy ecosystem of open source tools to facilitate cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most communities don&amp;rsquo;t already have skills in utilizing cloud workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Running infrastructure in the cloud takes dedicated time and expertise that many communities lack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many communities do not have organized communities of practice around cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These issues are true for most scientific communities, but they are exacerbated in countries that are often marginalized in the global scientific community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-proposed-work">
Our proposed work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-proposed-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For this reason, our goal in this grant is to &lt;strong>provide human and technical services to facilitate learning and knowledge transfer of cloud workflows for communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It defines four major areas of collaboration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure management&lt;/strong> - to facilitate access to cloud resources via managed cloud services that integrate open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Application guidance and training&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with the skills to utilize this infrastructure for their needs. This includes language-localized content and training materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Training for trainers&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to share these workflows with others in their communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Community leadership and management&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to sustain and grow healthy communities of practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If this proposal is funded, over the course of two years the team will provide a combination of the services described above for communities in Latin America and Africa, with the goal of understanding how such services can be most useful for these communities, how we can structure them to provide community representation in the direction of these services, and how we can sustain and scale this model of community-focused services for a global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Importantly, we wish to do this work in a way that centers the communities we work with as co-leaders and collaborators in these services.
We will explore ways to run these services and workshops so that they are transparent, inclusive, and give agency to the communities they support.
Ultimately, we hope that this can be an extensible model for many more communities in the future.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Symposium was framed by the interesting and interdisciplinary scientific career of the late
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Eddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jack Eddy&lt;/a>
. Eddy&amp;rsquo;s legacy was highlighted and his influence has been extended by dynamic leadership from NASA Program Officer
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership/lead-program-scientist-for-lws" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Madhulika Guhathakurta (Lika)&lt;/a>
. Lika helped launch and has sustained NASA&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/programs/living-with-a-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Living with a Star (LWS)&lt;/a>
program over the past two decades. Prior to LWS, NASA had a variety of siloed efforts focused on near-Sun and near-Earth behavior. The LWS program led to an integration of these efforts under &amp;ldquo;system science&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;systems engineering&amp;rdquo; approaches and an expressed desired to connect LWS research activities with impacts on Earth (society, biology, culture, etc.). The program has expanded to include explorations of similar questions arising around other planets in our solar system and the recently discovered collection of exoplanets. Scientists from diverse disciplines (plasma physics, stellar evolution, atmospheric chemistry, space weather, planetary science,&amp;hellip;) work together on &amp;ldquo;cross disciplinary&amp;rdquo; research that helps us understand our lives near our star.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Symposium focused on three disciplinary areas (&lt;strong>Exoplanets&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Sun-Climate and Star-Climate interactions&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Risk and resilience of space weather&lt;/strong>) unified under the cross-cutting thread of &lt;strong>open science&lt;/strong>. Frequent references were made to the upcoming 2023 Year of Open Science and
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA&amp;rsquo;s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission&lt;/a>
. Symposium attendees listened to talks surveying the four areas in the morning and participated in hackathon-style breakout projects during the afternoons. Work on the projects launched at the Eddy Symposium
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues&lt;/a>
. The space weather group is investigating ways to make the power grid more resilient. The Sun-climate group is exploring plans to establish an institute focused on Sun-climate interactions and improve connections between climate and heliophysics research communities. The exoplanets team is developing tools to programmatically compare Sun-Earth and star-exoplanet interactions.&lt;/p>

Access to the interactive computing platform was granted to any member of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Symposium&amp;rsquo;s GitHub organization&lt;/a>

. Fernando described the ways he, research collaborators, and students are using the Jupyter ecosystem. Diverse and curated tools in Jupyter hubs for the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter Meets the Earth Project&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s data science programs&lt;/a>
were highlighted. The talk showcased how these tools have been integrated to support individuals and communities of practice in data-driven research. In response to requests from the organizers and participants, Fernando gave a demonstration on how to use the hub 2i2c set up for the Symposium and an introduction to version control using &lt;code>git&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c co-founder Jim Colliander gave a talk titled
&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/eddy-science-commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Governing the Science Commons&lt;/a>
. Three key points from Jim&amp;rsquo;s talk were: the virtue that should guide the improvements to the scientific enterprise is intellectual generosity; implementation of intellectual generosity into science requires commons-based governance; the convergence of open source tools that support data-intensive collaborative research and learning (as showcased by Fernando) and agency interest (
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA TOPS&lt;/a>

&lt;p>We learned that our engineering team can rapidly deploy interactive computing resources to support a research and education community. Along the way, we confirmed what we&amp;rsquo;ve been learning from Pangeo and the neuroscience communities: flexible methods to customize the software environment are necessary. We confirmed that our developing
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/service/shared-responsibility.html?highlight=shared%20responsibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared responsibility model&lt;/a>
, enabling domain-specific experts to provide curated toolchains for their communities while leveraging 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure expertise, is the right approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned that managing access to the hub using members in a GitHub organization works but involves some toil since organizers had to work through the GitHub invitation process for each participant. We are exploring others ways to systematically grant event participants access to a hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Eddy Symposium experience reminded us that some skill at using &lt;code>git&lt;/code> is vital for collaboration. Fernando&amp;rsquo;s brief introduction to &lt;code>git&lt;/code> provided
&lt;a href="https://jack-eddy-symposium.github.io/intro-git-jupyter/intro-git/git-visuals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the mental model of working on a directed acyclyic graph&lt;/a>
. Roving support from Jim and Fernando during the afternoon hackathon sessions normalized the skill level across the groups but not without a few merge conflicts and frustration. Near the beginning of future workshops, we will follow an improved approach aimed at establishing good &lt;code>git&lt;/code> hygeine and familiarity with the collaboration workflow using a simple pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are honored to have had the opportunity to collaborate with the Eddy Symposium team by managing infrastructure and participating in the workshop. We learned a lot about how to support the Helio and adjacent communities, and are proud of the ways in which our infrastructure helped them do their work more openly and effectively. We hope to build on these successes with these and other communities in the future!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tech update: Multiple JupyterHubs, multiple clusters, one repository.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/ci-cd-improvements/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/ci-cd-improvements/</guid><description>&lt;p>2i2c manages the configuration and deployment of multiple Kubernetes clusters and JupyterHubs from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a single open infrastructure repository&lt;/a>
.
This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a short description of what we did and the benefit that it had.
It covers the technical details and provides links to more information about our deployment setup.
We hope that it helps other organizations make similar improvements to their own infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-problem">
Our problem
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-problem">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s problem is similar to that of many large organizations that have independent sub-communities within them.
We must centralize the operation and configuration of JupyterHubs in order to boost our efficiency in developing and operating them, but must also treat these hubs &lt;em>independently&lt;/em> because their user communities are not necessarily related, and because we want communities to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">be able to replicate their infrastructure on their own&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A year ago, we built the first version of our deployment infrastructure at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a>
.
Over the last year of operation, we identified a number of major shortcomings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Within a Kubernetes cluster, we deployed hubs sequentially, not in parallel. This grew out of a common practice of
&lt;a href="https://sre.google/workbook/canarying-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canary deployments&lt;/a>
that allowed us to test changes on a &lt;strong>staging hub&lt;/strong> before rolling them out to a &lt;strong>production hub&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We used a single configuration file for all hubs within a cluster, which led to confusion and difficulty in identifying a hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moreover, any change to a hub within a cluster caused a re-deploy of &lt;em>all hubs on that cluster&lt;/em>. This is because we did not know whether a given change touched cluster-wide configuration or hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="our-goal">
Our goal
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-goal">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, we spent several weeks discussing a plan to resolve these major problems - here were our goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We should be able to &lt;strong>upgrade a specific hub&lt;/strong> alone, by inspecting which configuration files have been added or modified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production hubs should be upgraded in parallel&lt;/strong> when they are effectively run independently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should &lt;strong>use staging hubs as &amp;ldquo;canary&amp;rdquo; deployments&lt;/strong> and not continue upgrading production hubs if the staging hub fails.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="an-overview-of-our-changes">
An overview of our changes
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#an-overview-of-our-changes">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>To accomplish this, we needed to identify which hub required an upgrade based on file additions/modifications.
This took a lot of discussion and iteration on design, and so we share it below in the hopes that it is helpful to others!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="improvements-to-our-code-and-structure">
Improvements to our code and structure
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#improvements-to-our-code-and-structure">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We made a few major changes to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the infrastructure repository&lt;/a>
to facilitate the deployment logic described above.
Here are the major changes we implemented:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We separated each hub&amp;rsquo;s configuration into its own file, or set of files. For example,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/staging.values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>staging&lt;/code> hub configuration&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We created a separate &lt;code>cluster.yaml&lt;/code> file that holds the canonical list of hubs deployed to that cluster and the configuration file(s) associated with each one. For example,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s GKE cluster configuration&lt;/a>
, which contains a reference to the previously mentioned
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml#L14-L26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staging hub&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We updated
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/master/deployer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our deployer module&lt;/a>
to do the following things:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inspect the list of files modified in a Pull Request.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From this list, calculate the name of a hub that required an upgrade, and the name of its respective cluster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys changes in parallel for each cluster/hub pair.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to these structural and code changes, we also developed new GitHub Actions workflows that control the entire process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-github-actions-workflow-for-upgrading-our-jupyterhubs">
A GitHub Actions workflow for upgrading our JupyterHubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-github-actions-workflow-for-upgrading-our-jupyterhubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We defined a new GitHub Actions workflow that carries out the logic described above.
These are all defined in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-hubs.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this &lt;code>deploy-hubs.yaml&lt;/code> configuration file&lt;/a>
.
Here are the major jobs in this workflow, and what each does:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>generate-jobs&lt;/code>: Generate a list of clusters/hubs that must be upgraded, given the files that are changed in a Pull Request.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Evaluate an input list of added/modified files in a PR&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide if the added/modified files warrant an upgrade of a hub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generate a list of hubs and clusters that require upgrades, and some extra details:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does the support chart that is deployed to the cluster also need an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does a staging hub on this cluster require an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This produced two outputs to be used in subsequent steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &lt;strong>human-readable table&lt;/strong> including information on &lt;em>why&lt;/em> a given deployment requires an upgrade (using the excellent
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich library&lt;/a>
).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JSON outputs&lt;/strong> that can be interpreted by GitHub Actions as sets of matrix jobs to run.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>filter-generate-jobs&lt;/code>: Allows us to treat the support / staging hubs as canary deployments for all the production hubs on a cluster.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks">
Concluding Remarks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#concluding-remarks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We think that this is a nice balance of infrastructure complexity and flexibility.
It allows us to separate the configuration of each hub and cluster, which makes each more maintainable by us, and is more aligned with a community&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
their infrastructure.
It allows us to remove the interdependence of deploy jobs that do not &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to be dependent, which makes our deploys more efficient.
Finally, it allows us to make &lt;em>targeted deploys&lt;/em> more effectively, which reduces the amount of toil and unnecessary waiting associated with each change. (It also
&lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-04-22-environmental-sustainability-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces our carbon footprint by reducing unnecessary GitHub Action time&lt;/a>
).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this is a useful resource for others to follow if they also maintain JupyterHubs for multiple communities.
If you have any ideas of how we could further improve this infrastructure, please reach out on GitHub!
If you know of a community that would like 2i2c to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage a hub for your community&lt;/a>
, please

This is a quick post to celebrate the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past three months, and to briefly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main highlights from this quarter - if you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out more of the work that we&amp;rsquo;ve done, see:&lt;/p>

Infrastructure improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#infrastructure-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This quarter we did a deep dive into a number of core infrastructure improvements for our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed JupyterHubs Service&lt;/a>
.
Here are a few highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infrastructure reliability and efficiency&lt;/strong>. We
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of our deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>
. For example, we refactored our hub configuration so that each community is better-able to track it, we implemented validation steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally push incorrect config to the hubs, and we&amp;rsquo;ve significantly improved our CI/CD pipeline to push deployments out to our hubs more efficiently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automatic deployments to commercial cloud&lt;/strong>. With the ICESat hackweek as a test-case for AWS, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished automating the deployment of clusters and hubs to each major commercial cloud. (there&amp;rsquo;s not a specific issue for this as it has been a multi-month effort over many PRs and issues!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CILogon authentication&lt;/strong>.
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
is a non-profit organization that provides &amp;ldquo;single-sign on&amp;rdquo; authentication services for the same communities that 2i2c serves. We&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with them to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/1089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prototype using CILogon for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s hubs&lt;/a>
, which should make it much easier for communities to user their own institutional sign-ons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">
Communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served and lessons learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As described in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Managed Hub Services strategy&lt;/a>
, our goals for this phase of our organization are to balance &lt;em>serving communities of practice&lt;/em> and &lt;em>learning where we can improve our infrastructure and practices&lt;/em>.
With that in mind, here are a few highlights of communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served, and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We grew a hub for
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the University of Toronto&lt;/a>
to around 4000 monthly users&lt;/strong>. This has taught us a lot about where our support and operations can and cannot scale, and where we have gaps in our sustainability / pricing model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed CILogon on a hub for
&lt;a href="https://anu.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a class at Australian National University&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This gives us an opportunity to work out any UX issues and improvements to be made before a deeper CILogon integration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a dedicated database per user for
&lt;a href="https://utexas.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a databases course at UT Austin&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This is helping us learn more about how to pair slightly more customized per-user infrastructure with our standard hub setups, as well as how our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate model&lt;/a>
could be followed for more complex setups like a database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scotty_h_q/status/1508557909751320577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ICESat2 HackWeek&lt;/a>
at the University of Washington&lt;/strong>. This helped refine our infrastructure and expertise with AWS, as well as improved our event &amp;ldquo;ready mode&amp;rdquo; practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a new hub for
&lt;a href="https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LEAP project&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This has given us an opportunity to prototype new processes for pass-through cloud costs to simplify our deployments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizational improvements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond our technical and community impact work, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of significant organizational improvements as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new role in Product and Community Management&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re excited for this new hire to spearhead efforts in guiding and developing relationships with the communities we serve, as well as guiding and collaborating with our engineering team in developing our services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Project Manager role&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. Our engineering team had been operating as a largely autonomous and independent group, but we&amp;rsquo;ve realized that we would benefit from someone to help coordinate our actions and plans, especially as we balance more operations/support issues in addition to new development. This new role is an experiment at growing this capacity within our team, in the hopes that we can dedicate a team member to it in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We are still working out our major priorities for the oncoming quarter, but have a few major projects in the works that we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful to make progress on quickly.
Here are a few major examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our process and operations around supporting our users&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing first- and second-line support processes&lt;/a>
to make our team more responsive and effective at resolving incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and contracting process&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing how to reduce toil associated with invoicing&lt;/a>
in order to make this practice more reliable and efficient, along with our fiscal sponsor
&lt;a href="https://codeforscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving our reporting and monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;d like to boost our ability to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitor activity on each of our hubs&lt;/a>
in order to identify when something abnormal is happening and get ahead of any potential problems (e.g., to avoid unintentionally large cloud bills). We&amp;rsquo;d also like to improve our usage reporting to more create more accurate cloud bills for hubs running on multi-tenant clusters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a lot more planned for 2i2c, and if you&amp;rsquo;re curious to see what we&amp;rsquo;re up to, we invite you to
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our team compass&lt;/a>
to learn about our practices, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch our activity on GitHub&lt;/a>

&lt;p>Many thanks to the amazing 2i2c team, and the multiple open source and scholarly communities that we collaborate with to make all of this possible. In addition, we are grateful to

We are looking forward to Q2! 🎉&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes from our drop-in meeting about the Product and Community Lead role</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday we had a quick &amp;ldquo;drop-in&amp;rdquo; session to take questions about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead">job posting for a Product and Community Lead&lt;/a>
.
We spent the hour discussing a number of questions that others had about the position.
Below is a short overview of the questions and some responses, for those who were not able to attend.
These responses are a bit rough, since they are mostly off-the-cuff based on the questions asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2022-03-24&lt;/strong>: We&amp;rsquo;ve added extra questions and answers below from our latest drop-in meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-success-look-like-in-the-short-and-long-term">
What does success look like in the short and long term?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-success-look-like-in-the-short-and-long-term">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is an important question, with a few different kinds of answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As noted, this is the first hire of its kind inside of 2i2c, and it should bring a strategic and organization-building eye to the work that it does.
To some extent, this role will be tasked with coming up with their own answers to these questions.
This person should build a near- and long-term strategy for how Product and Community Engagement should evolve to be most-effective in accomplishing our mission.
This will also mean defining goals and a strategy to meet these goals over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind, here are a few ideas we have in mind for goals that will drive this role:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6 month goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Become familiar with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organization, culture, mission, and team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define an early strategy for how you&amp;rsquo;d like to incorporate Product and Community engagement into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s operations, and set some Objectives or Key Results that we should use to measure success. This should include a plan for the two major objectives of this role: guiding and connecting with the communities we serve, and building design and planning processes that bring this perspective into our engineering and services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A few iterations on the execution of this strategy, with some demonstration of impact as well as some documented lessons learned.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 year goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An organizational strategy and structure has been created, defining the various roles that make up this division of 2i2c and their functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clearly defined team processes for major programs efforts that this role oversees, as well as interconnections with other major divisions of 2i2c (e.g. engineering or sales). For example, a framework for training community leaders and mechanisms or platforms for communication and engagement with our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A team exists that carries out these efforts, led by the Product and Community Lead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clear demonstrated impact in the communities we serve, according to the OKRs and goals that have been set in this division.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-2i2c-provide-mentorshiponboarding">
How does 2i2c provide mentorship/onboarding?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-does-2i2c-provide-mentorshiponboarding">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>You can find
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/get-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our onboarding process in our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.
This roughly comes down to choosing an &amp;ldquo;Onboarding Champion&amp;rdquo; for the new team member, to help walk them through our team processes and get them access to the right information and accounts.
However, 2i2c is quite young, so has only had a few iterations in onboarding new team members.
We look forward to improving this process further via this new hire.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-largest-challenges-that-someone-might-face-in-their-first-year-in-this-position">
What are the largest challenges that someone might face in their first year in this position?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-the-largest-challenges-that-someone-might-face-in-their-first-year-in-this-position">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The largest challenge is largely related to ambiguity and fluidity of this role, due to the fact that 2i2c is small and relatively young.
As noted above, this position will have a great deal of autonomy, and will be expected to show leadership in defining the nature of this work within 2i2c.
This can either be exciting or scary depending on your comfort level with ambiguity!
We recognize that it is an anti-pattern to have roles without clearly-defined measures of success, so we&amp;rsquo;re committed to defining this quickly in partnership with the new hire.
However, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be overly-prescriptive in this role, because we want it to have space to lead these efforts within 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-hope-to-protect-the-business-aspects-of-2i2c-if-all-the-tech-is-open-source">
How do you hope to protect the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; aspects of 2i2c, if all the tech is open source?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-you-hope-to-protect-the-business-aspects-of-2i2c-if-all-the-tech-is-open-source">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is to some extent committing to a limiting business model: by respecting the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
, we &lt;em>encourage&lt;/em> other organizations to perform the exact same kinds of services that 2i2c offers.
However, we believe this is in-line with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission, and would consider this to be a measure of impact rather than a sustainability problem.
In short: our goal is not to become a tech giant or start-up unicorn, we want to sustain a team with competitive pay, and we want to scale as there is more opportunity to serve new communities.
We believe that the complexity of integrating tools and managing cloud services means that there will always be enough of an opportunity to bring in ample funding for this model.
We also hope that our mission-driven nature and focus on research and education will bring in new kinds of funding opportunities that can sustain 2i2c and its mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-would-applying-the-1000-true-fans-approach-work-in-terms-of-advocacy">
How would applying the &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; approach work in terms of advocacy?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-would-applying-the-1000-true-fans-approach-work-in-terms-of-advocacy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1000 true fans&lt;/a>
approach suggests that it is enough to leverage the support of &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; to sustain a product or service.
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered 2i2c in this light before, but believe it aligns well with our strategy.
A common pattern 2i2c follows is to build connections with &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; in the communities that we wish to serve.
These individuals are passionate about open science, open source, and community-led workflows.
They advocate for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s services, and also serve as leaders for the kinds of workflows that 2i2c wishes to enable.
We believe that our mission-alignment with research and education, and our focus on empowering community leaders, will position us to build support and dedicated collaborators across these sectors.
We also hope that by centering Jupyter infrastructure in the services we offer, we can benefit from the recognition and demand for this ecosystem via our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-challenges-have-you-run-into-thus-far">
What challenges have you run into thus far?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-challenges-have-you-run-into-thus-far">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are many things we could respond with here!
In this meeting, we discussed two major challenges we continue to iterate on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Walking the line between &amp;ldquo;software as a service&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;custom infrastructure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. 2i2c seeks to run infrastructure &lt;em>on behalf of&lt;/em> other communities, but in a scalable and sustainable way.
This means that we must centralize configuration and deployment, but use a standardized stack that benefits from economies of scale.
This is a complex problem, especially at the interface points with university bureacracies.
For example, many universities require a &lt;em>university email&lt;/em> in order to manage cloud infrastructure in their organization - doing this for each of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers is not a sustainable practice, and we must define creative ways to balance the security concerns of universities with our desire to run &lt;em>their&lt;/em> infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building a distributed organization from scratch&lt;/strong>. The other major challenge we&amp;rsquo;ve faced is simply the act of creating an organization from the ground up.
We have worked together for many years in open source communities, but there&amp;rsquo;s a new degree of complexity when you&amp;rsquo;re all working on the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> service and development efforts.
Throw in a largely asynchronous team split across many time zones, and there are a lot of coordination and planning challenges to overcome.
We have tried many things over the past year (see
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest team practices in the team compass&lt;/a>
, but there is still a lot of improvement to make.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-crucial-is-a-deep-seated-knowledge-of-jupyter-for-this-role">
How crucial is a deep-seated knowledge of Jupyter for this role?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-crucial-is-a-deep-seated-knowledge-of-jupyter-for-this-role">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s not strictly required for somebody to have a knowledge of Jupyter, we think it will be an important part of this role (at least from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective).
This position is not an engineer, and won&amp;rsquo;t be expected to understand the inner-workings of Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.
However, it will be crucial that this role understand what is possible with JupyterHub, Notebooks, Jupyter Book, etc, and develop and teach best-practices in applying these tools for research and education.
They&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a deep &lt;em>intuition&lt;/em> for how to use Jupyter tools, how they should be improved, and how they can be integrated together for new services (along with other tools in the open source community).
More important than anything is a deep interest in this ecosystem, and a desire to learn, but having prior experience with the Jupyter stack and similar workflows will be a big benefit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-level-of-technical-expertise-is-needed-for-this-position">
What level of technical expertise is needed for this position?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-level-of-technical-expertise-is-needed-for-this-position">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ideally, they should have the expertise of a &amp;ldquo;power user&amp;rdquo; of the infrastructure and usecases that we work with.
We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this role to have software development or cloud infrastructure engineering expertise, but they should understand what it is like to &lt;strong>use&lt;/strong> these tools from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, and have an intuition about how to improve the workflows.
They should be able to communicate with and collaborate with engineers effectively, so understanding development workflows will be helpful, but they do not need core expertise in software development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-it-kind-of-like-a-scientific--technical-writer">
Is it kind of like a scientific / technical writer?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#is-it-kind-of-like-a-scientific--technical-writer">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The skills of a scientific or technical writer would certainly be relevant for this position.
For example, somebody that enjoyed technical documentation or scientific communication likely has one relevant skillset for this role.
However, the role will do much more than &lt;em>just&lt;/em> technical writing - they will also create and execute on organizational strategy, collaborate with our team around designing and planning our work, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-scientific-knowledge-in-a-specific-domain-important">
Is scientific knowledge in a specific domain important?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#is-scientific-knowledge-in-a-specific-domain-important">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this person to have deep knowledge in any particular scientific field, though experience with scientific and educational workflows in general will be very beneficial.
2i2c&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build expertise in the aspects of interactive computing workflows that overlap between many research / educational communities.
We hope to work with leaders from these communities to leverage their domain expertise, and to empower them to lead others.
Similar to having technical expertise, the important thing is having an intuition for what it&amp;rsquo;s like to use the infrastructure, what &lt;em>kinds of problems&lt;/em> our target communities are trying to solve, and how to learn more about their perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-the-role-involve-writing-grants-for-the-sustainability-of-the-project">
Does the role involve writing grants for the sustainability of the project?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-the-role-involve-writing-grants-for-the-sustainability-of-the-project">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This role isn&amp;rsquo;t tasked specifically with identifying and writing grants, though it is likely that they will collaborate with others at 2i2c in crafting grant language or pursuing similar opportunities.
2i2c is a small organization and so we all tend to wear many hats, though we try to keep each person&amp;rsquo;s efforts focused on their core responsibilities.
In this case, those responsibilities are community guidance and engagement, as well as service / product design in collaboration with our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-communications-would-this-role-oversee">
What kinds of communications would this role oversee?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-kinds-of-communications-would-this-role-oversee">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is hard to know right now and may evolve over time, but we expect this role will primarily communicate with pre-existing communities that we serve.
They will also foster communication between leaders within these communities.
They may interface with communities that 2i2c seeks to serve in the future (for example, in collaboration with sales and partnerships), but their focus will be on cultivating and guiding the communities we already work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="term-for-this-position">
Term for this position
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#term-for-this-position">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We hire all team members on one-year contracts with an annual review and the expectation to renew the contract for another year (unless we explicitly say otherwise).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-are-the-communities-you-work-with">
Where are the communities you work with?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#where-are-the-communities-you-work-with">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Here are a few characteristics of the communities we &lt;em>currently&lt;/em> work with, though we aspire to broaden this group significantly (for example, we wish to expand our focus outside of North American and Europe):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They tend to be focused in North America and in Europe (this is likely due to our pre-existing connections)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They cover a broad range of use-cases, from small- and large-scale education in single institutions, to small- and large-scale research communities that are distributed across the globe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A common pattern is to work with &amp;ldquo;community champions&amp;rdquo; that are interested in our technology and serve as leaders to bring these workflows to their respective communities. We seek to build more connections with people like this, and cultivate our relationship with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aspirationally, we hope to grow our reach to more communities outside of these countries, in order to achieve our mission of reaching a global audience.
Doing so will require more sophistication in our coordination and pricing, in order to match our services and support model with communities outside of North America and Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2i2c-is-young-and-without-much-structure-how-do-you-plan-to-add-more-structure-over-time-what-support-will-this-role-have">
2i2c is young and without much structure. How do you plan to add more structure over time? What support will this role have?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#2i2c-is-young-and-without-much-structure-how-do-you-plan-to-add-more-structure-over-time-what-support-will-this-role-have">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is the first role of its kind, and so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with a relatively fluid environment.
We all believe strongly in building good organizational support structures, but we are a young organization that is still developing this capacity internally.
Your immediate primary support system will be the other strategic leadership of 2i2c - the Executive Director, Steering Council members (on an ad-hoc basis), and other team members.
Over time, we look forward to building more formal support networks between divisions of 2i2c and our team members.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-this-person-need-to-be-on-an-americaeurope-time-zone">
Does this person need to be on an America/Europe time zone?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-this-person-need-to-be-on-an-americaeurope-time-zone">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The team is currently distributed between US/Pacific and Eastern European time zones, and this also matches the majority of communities we currently work with, so it will be important for this person to have several hours overlap with at least one of those two (the more the better).
In the short run, it is likely that a person within these time zones will have the least barriers to team and community collaboration.
However, we do not have any strict rules about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the longer term, we are committed to building distributed team practices that do not cause team members to pay large penalties for being in a particular time zone, and we look forward to finding creative solutions to this challenge.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This role will guide and empower the communities that we serve, learn from them, and bring their perspective to guide our service and product development. It is similar to a mixture of product management and community and developer advocacy in a tech firm, but adjusted for research, education, and open source contexts. It is also similar to a
&lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Research Applications Manager&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
, but with a focus on using and developing infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The skills required are a combination of communication, teaching, learning, service design and delivery, and technical acumen. The person that fills this role should feel comfortable learning and sharing ideas, empowering and guiding others, and communicating clearly and collaboratively with a variety of stakeholders including end-users and engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a leadership role for a strategy-minded practitioner. 2i2c is a young organization, and this role will have a large degree of autonomy and flexibility. We have defined the starting point, but we seek someone who can bring a strategic eye to this position. Over time we hope that the role will grow to define and lead this style of work within 2i2c more broadly.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-youll-do">
What you’ll do
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-youll-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This role is a combination of connecting, guiding, leading, learning, communicating, and empowering stakeholders in the communities we serve, as well as the 2i2c engineering team. Here are some key focus areas with core responsibilities under each:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="guiding-and-learning-from-communities-we-serve">
Guiding and learning from communities we serve
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#guiding-and-learning-from-communities-we-serve">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our users are often not &amp;ldquo;power-users&amp;rdquo; with Jupyter, open source workflows, or cloud-native workflows. This role should work with users of these communities to guide them in using our infrastructure for maximal impact. Below are a few example responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Understand the goals and needs of the communities we serve&lt;/strong>, as well as the major pain points and problems that they have. This understanding may not be directly communicated and will be gained through active observation. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Create and engage in spaces for sharing information with users.&lt;/strong> For example, online forums and live community discussions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engage in community-specific spaces.&lt;/strong> This role may monitor and participate in community spaces in either research or education (e.g.,
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo forum&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://discourse.jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Jupyter forum&lt;/a>
, or forums for education communities) to track relevant conversation and provide guidance as-needed.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Guide communities and their leaders for the use-cases that 2i2c wishes to enable&lt;/strong>, and how our infrastructure (Jupyter, JupyterHub, open source tools, etc) can be used to have the most impact. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop user-facing materials&lt;/strong> (documentation, workshops, talks, etc) that demonstrate the basic use-cases that we support, and the best ways that the infrastructure can be used to accomplish community goals. For example “Teaching with Jupyter” or “An Introduction to Scalable Computing with Dask.”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Provide one-on-one or group guidance to our user communities&lt;/strong> (particularly leaders in those communities) with the goal of transferring knowledge that they can then share within their peers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Foster deeper external relationships and engagements&lt;/strong> with key communities of practice and partners that are important for 2i2c’s strategy, such as the
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Project&lt;/a>
(which is a key stakeholder for this role).&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engage with potential communities and stakeholders&lt;/strong>, with a focus on demonstrating the use-cases we hope to support and generating new service contracts with these communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Communicate externally to demonstrate impact.&lt;/strong> For example, by participating in meetings, conferences, and other events where we have an opportunity to highlight the work that 2i2c does.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Interact extensively with open source communities&lt;/strong> that underlie our infrastructure, potentially serving in leadership roles and doing significant work to support these communities. There will be a particular focus on the Jupyter and PyData ecosystems.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="guide-product-and-service-design-and-implementation">
Guide product and service design and implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#guide-product-and-service-design-and-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This role should understand the perspectives of our users and the use-cases we wish to enable, and bring this perspective to guide the evolution of our services and infrastructure. Below are a few example responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Represent user communities and communicate their needs&lt;/strong> to the engineering team, leadership team, and other stakeholders. For example:&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This is the first position of its kind within 2i2c, and it will have freedom to shape its strategy and role with the organization. It should oversee the evolution and growth of this &lt;em>kind&lt;/em> of work within 2i2c, and develop organizational strategy for how to maximize our impact. Below are a few ways that this might occur (both independently and in partnership with others at 2i2c):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop a product and service culture&lt;/strong> that balances intuition, community research, and data to create delightful experiences and maximize our impact.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define key goals and evaluation criteria for the success of our communities&lt;/strong>, and work with others at 2i2c to measure and refine these goals, communicate our impact internally, and use this experience to refine our team processes and strategy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop an organizational strategy&lt;/strong> for how 2i2c should grow its service and community engagement operations over time, including making new hires, defining new roles, and defining interconnections between these roles and the broader 2i2c team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Develop a communications plan&lt;/strong> that communicates 2i2c’c impact and positions 2i2c as a leading advocate for community-owned interactive computing infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Collaborate around sustainability and stakeholder engagement&lt;/strong>. 2i2c aims to sustain itself through a combination of paid services, grants, and stakeholder partnerships. This role will collaborate with others at 2i2c in defining and carrying out these efforts.&lt;/li>

We are seeking a product and community lead with the following two goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Empower the communities we serve to have impact with our infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guide our development and service design to reflect the needs of our users.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This role will work alongside our engineering team as a partner, and will serve as a high-bandwidth interface to the communities that we work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a link to the full job posting below, the rest of this post is a short rationale for this role, and how we hope it will fit within 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team and strategy.&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-new-role">
Why a new role?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-a-new-role">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When 2i2c began a year ago, we hired a team of engineers that had experience in cloud infrastructure, Jupyter, and open source ecosystems. In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve built out the infrastructure foundation for scalable interactive computing environments that are customizable for the community, and respects their
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/content/right-to-replicate/">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, solely providing infrastructure is not enough. Working with the modern open source stack, using the cloud to its advantage, and bringing these tools into specific domains requires a lot of extra experience and expertise. We believe that 2i2c is in a good position to &lt;strong>provide guidance and support to leaders in the communities that we serve&lt;/strong>, allowing them to get up-to-speed with the infrastructure more effectively so that they can have an impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned that it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to &lt;strong>develop infrastructure in collaboration with the communities that we&amp;rsquo;re serving&lt;/strong>. A team of engineers tends to focus on code and infrastructure, and having a role that focuses on connecting with communities will give them an excellent perspective on what those communities need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this role will combine these two aspects to create a culture of learning, sharing, and guiding between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team and the communities that we work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-similar-roles">
What are similar roles?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-similar-roles">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We tried to find similar roles in the private and non-profit sector, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that was a perfect fit. However, there were a few close matches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is kind-of like a &lt;strong>product manager&lt;/strong> - their job is to understand the communities that we work with, and to use this to help us make decisions about what to build, how to present it, and how to engage with stakeholders. They will need to help us prioritize the work that is most impactful for our mission, and help us navigate trade-offs in the evolution of our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is also kind-of like a &lt;strong>customer success manager&lt;/strong> or a &lt;strong>developer advocate&lt;/strong> - they will guide and teach those in the communities we serve - particularly community leaders that go on to teach others - how to use our infrastructure most-effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, the closest role we could find is a relatively new one: the
&lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Research Applications Manager&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
. This is a role that has been pioneered by the Turing Institute, and is similarly described as a connector that brings together many perspectives and encourages a participatory, team-based approach to research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the reality is that the person in this role will ultimately get to shape the nature of their work within 2i2c. As a young organization, there is a lot of flexibility for creativity and experimentation in bringing new skillsets into our organization. We hope that the person who fills this role will be excited about growing a culture of team-based approaches to our engineering and collaborations, and to share this culture with the communities that we serve.&lt;/p>

In this year we have grown, experimented, and accomplished a lot - we have also faced challenges and learned as a team. Our primary goal in 2021 was to build a strong foundation for 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reflect on our work thus far, we&amp;rsquo;re writing three blog posts that describe progress in major areas of work towards this foundation for 2i2c.
These three areas are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Creating services for use-cases&lt;/strong> - these are our first managed infrastructure offerings for communities in research and education.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Developing cloud infrastructure and tools&lt;/strong> - this is the technical backbone that makes these services possible, built entirely on open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building an organizational foundation&lt;/strong> - this is the creation of our team structures, processes, and culture that help us carry out our mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This first post will focus on &lt;strong>services that we&amp;rsquo;ve created in our first year&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission is to facilitate use-cases in research and education via open source development and services. Throughout 2021 we ran several pilots to learn more about the needs of communities in research and education, and how we could build sustainable services that meet these needs. Here are some highlights for each major use-case we have targeted thus far:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="educational-community-hubs">
Educational community hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#educational-community-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A primary use-case that 2i2c seeks to enable is &lt;strong>collaborative, distributed educational spaces for learning with data&lt;/strong>. In 2021 we ran several pilots with educational communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A university-wide hub for the University of Toronto.&lt;/strong> This hub is used in a variety of classes throughout the university, and is made freely available to anyone with a UofT account. We hope to repeat this model for other university-wide communities, and have learned a lot about the challenges of working with particularly large educational communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Several hubs for community colleges across California.&lt;/strong> In partnership with UC Berkeley and CloudBank, we&amp;rsquo;ve run several hubs for nearly a dozen small community colleges teaching the
&lt;a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data 8 curriculum&lt;/a>
for their students. These hubs are lightweight and offer standardized environments for their students to use, in order to lower the cost of deploying and maintaining the hubs over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned">
What we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The organizational context around educational use-cases is different from research communities. Compared with research groups, educucational groups have more variance in their size (classes as small as 10 people and as large as 500) and think about cost &lt;strong>by the student&lt;/strong>, not as a lump sum. This means that our initial hub-based pricing model may not map cleanly onto educational contexts, and we need to improve the match of scalability and price to these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that for these communities, navigating all of the open source tools that are available for pedagogy is confusing! Everybody wants auto-grading but it&amp;rsquo;s unclear what is the &amp;ldquo;right tool for the job&amp;rdquo;. Tools like
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nbgitpuller&lt;/a>
have heavy use at &amp;ldquo;power universities&amp;rdquo; like UC Berkeley, but many others don&amp;rsquo;t know that it exists! We will need to invest more time into building guides and documentation that help others leverage these tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="research-in-the-cloud">
Research in the cloud
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#research-in-the-cloud">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to educational use-cases, we ran several pilots for research communities in order to leverage cloud infrastructure for scaling their work or collaborating more effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We migrated Pangeo’s cloud infrastructure to be run via 2i2c.&lt;/strong> The
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Community&lt;/a>
had been operating and developing their own JupyterHub for several years, but were looking for another organization to provide more reliable/sustained operations and support for their Pangeo Cloud Service. This year we migrated the service
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/pangeo-goes-live/">to run off of 2i2c’s deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A scalable cloud hub for a SWOT satellite team&lt;/strong>. The
&lt;a href="https://meom-group.github.io/projects/swot-st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEOM research group at Grenoble&lt;/a>
is doing work with the
&lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA SWOT satellite project&lt;/a>
. However, the datasets generated from this project are huge, and only storable via the cloud. We&amp;rsquo;ve set up a JupyterHub to provide cloud-based access to this data, running a Pangeo-like environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-1">
What we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-learned-1">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Research communities tend to have more usecase-specific needs than educational ones. While introductory courses in data science tend to be similar across institutions, research needs are much more unique to the problem and team at hand. Moreover, they tend to want infrastructure that runs via institutional cloud accounts. This is possible due to the flexible nature of Jupyter and JupyterHub, but brings extra challenges in bureacracy and access permissions, given that 2i2c engineers usually are not members of these organizations already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, many research use-cases are based around the &lt;strong>location of the data&lt;/strong>. This is because data is the hardest thing to move from cloud to cloud. For this reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important to &lt;strong>bring interactive sessions to the data&lt;/strong>. Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem makes this possible, but we&amp;rsquo;d like to do more to make this easier. For example, users should be able to launch interactive sessions across many clusters or datacenters, regardless of their hub&amp;rsquo;s location. They should also have more customized control over their environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="distributed-events-and-hackweeks">
Distributed events and hackweeks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#distributed-events-and-hackweeks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we had a special use-case that is a hybrid of the previous two examples. Events and hackweeks are &lt;em>time-bounded&lt;/em>, &lt;em>focused on learning and doing&lt;/em>, but often &lt;em>with research workflows and communities&lt;/em>. They also tend to be more globally-distributed than a traditional research or education community.
See below for a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://coessing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
workshop is a summer school run in Ghana to share skills and workflows with researchers across Africa. It builds on workflows in the Pangeo ecosystem, and teaches attendees how to work with cloud-native data. By using a cloud-based JupyterHub for their workshop, attendees had direct access to data and compute in a way that would have been much more difficult to set up on local infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="http://linked.earth/paleoHackathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>PaleoHackWeek hackathons&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
were two hackathons around paleo/climate data workflows. They brought together a distributed community and use the 2i2c hub to facilitate the use of the
&lt;a href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paleoclim package&lt;/a>
throughout the hackweek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.openscapes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>OpenScapes&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. They have several cohorts of scientific trainees learning more about adopting open and collaborative workflows, and use a hub managed by 2i2c to provide remote learning environments for their workshops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-2">
What we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-learned-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Initially we assumed that event-based hubs would be similar to educational use-cases. However, in practice they are more complex. First, event organizers have ever-changing communities of users on their hubs. They often want to provide access to many new users in each event, and expect only a small subset to continue using the infrastructure after an event. Finally, one-off events also generate spikes in activity that are more intense than educational use-cases, and warrant more dedicated attention from our engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-that-we-faced">
Challenges that we faced
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-that-we-faced">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As we piloted these use-cases, we also ran into a few challenges in designing services around our infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Balancing standard deployments, custom deployments, and scalability&lt;/strong>. Our goal is to centralize our deployment and operations infrastructure in order to reduce the maintenance burden for each community hub. This will allow us to gain economies of scale and lower costs. However, there’s an inherent tension between scalability and customizability - in order to scale we must standardize the infrastructure we offer, but communities often want environments that are unique to their use-case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Turning services into sustainability&lt;/strong>. We’ve learned that charging money for things does not come naturally to us. We’ve spent many years building technology and services that were offered freely to the public. This was easy to provide, but difficult to sustain. 2i2c’s goal is to offer similar services, but with a sustainability model that allows us to employ team members to do this work, and to grow in the future. Understanding how to pair the right technology, use-case, and service with a particular pricing model is an area where we must learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What’s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Piloting all of these services taught us a lot about the similarities and differences between each use case. Towards the end of 2021, this led to 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first collection of &amp;ldquo;service offerings&amp;rdquo; for a Managed Jupyter Service. This includes a 2-by-2 matrix of service options, and a specific price point for each. We have begun offering this service to communities, in order to learn more about the model, the pricing, and any changes that should be made. In early 2022, we hope to expand this group to more communities so that we can test this model’s ability to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our next post in this series will focus on the underlying technology that powers the services described above, stay tuned for more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Cloud&lt;/a>
is an experimental service providing public cloud-based data-science environments for data-intensive geoscience research.
We have recently finished re-creating the
&lt;a href="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>
community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a>
repository.
This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one!
The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community.
It will be available at the same URL (
&lt;a href="https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io&lt;/a>
) and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place.
Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work.
Please see
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/migration-of-us-central1-b-gcp-pangeo-io-to-2i2c-infrastructure/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Discourse thread&lt;/a>
as an initial place to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;strong>22nd November 2021&lt;/strong>, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub.
Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">
History of Pangeo Cloud Hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the
&lt;a href="https://annual.ametsoc.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting&lt;/a>
; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs.
This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable.
Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure.
However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed.
Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">
The Pangeo-2i2c Partnership
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c&lt;/a>
is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows.
We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem.
We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities.
Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project&amp;rsquo;s technical stacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities.
We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/notes-from-the-pangeo-2i2c-kick-off-meeting/1587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kick-off thread on Discourse&lt;/a>
.
This approach allows each community to focus on it&amp;rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s workflows.
In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c.
Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community.
We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! 🚀&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Community update Q3 2021: A new fiscal sponsor, improving our infrastructure, nearing an alpha launch.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we&amp;rsquo;re up to next. In addition, almost all of the work we do is public and discoverable across
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our GitHub repositories&lt;/a>
, and is tracked by GitHub issues.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=org:2i2c-org&amp;#43;type:issue&amp;#43;is:closed&amp;#43;closed:2021-06-01..2021-10-01&amp;#43;-label:%22type:&amp;#43;team-sync%22&amp;#43;is:issue&amp;amp;type=issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of issues we&amp;rsquo;ve closed in ~Q3&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is amazing how quickly 4 months goes by when you&amp;rsquo;re building an organization from scratch! It seems like only a few weeks ago that we were recapping the beginning of the year in
&lt;a href="../six-month-update">our last community update&lt;/a>
. Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we&amp;rsquo;ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover major highlights, challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced, and where we&amp;rsquo;re going next.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">
Highlights
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#highlights">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="managed-jupyterhub-service">
Managed JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we&amp;rsquo;ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation across cloud providers&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS&lt;/a>
as well as
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure&lt;/a>
to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Monitoring and reporting infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We have worked on the JupyterHub
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>grafana-dashboards&lt;/code> project&lt;/a>
to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User environment management&lt;/strong>. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve improved the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker GitHub action&lt;/a>
to work with more image registries, and created a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/hub-user-image-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c user image template repository&lt;/a>
for users to re-use for their hubs. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/environment.html#bring-your-own-docker-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the User Environment docs&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support and collaboration roles&lt;/strong>. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the &lt;strong>community representative&lt;/strong> role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the user roles documentation&lt;/a>
for more information. We have also begun prototyping a
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshDesk support model&lt;/a>
and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pangeo">
Pangeo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#pangeo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are working with &lt;strong>the Pangeo Community&lt;/strong> to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the
&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executable Books Project&lt;/a>
. As such, we have begun shifting our attention to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for sustaining the project&amp;rsquo;s community beyond this grant&lt;/a>
. In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="jupyterhub-community-support">
JupyterHub community support
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-community-support">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We recently collaborated with the JupyterHub community to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for two CZI EOSS awards&lt;/a>
. Last month, we were notified that
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/jupyterhub-community-strategic-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our application to support a Community Strategic Lead&lt;/a>
was funded! This role will fund Sarah Gibson&amp;rsquo;s time to focus some of her thinking on building community structures and dynamics that are inclusive and sustainable. We&amp;rsquo;ll update with more information as this project starts moving.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="organizational-foundations">
Organizational foundations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-foundations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, in addition to our major development and projects, we have also made a lot of progress at an organizational level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>began
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/css-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fiscal sponsorship with Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This provides a new organizational and legal home for 2i2c after spending nearly a year receiving
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical strategic and start-up support&lt;/a>
from our previous host,
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICSI&lt;/a>
. We are excited to work with CS&amp;amp;S to create the business infrastructure that will power our managed JupyterHubs service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2i2c team has also been &lt;strong>improving our team planning and coordination processes&lt;/strong>, so that we can more effectively execute on our mission. As a distributed team, we have the challenge of building processes for team communication, coordination, and planning that are distributed and asynchronous. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you can learn more about our coordination processes in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have &lt;strong>improved our organization-wide documentation&lt;/strong> in order to make it easier to navigate between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s various sources of information. We hope that this provides more transparency into what 2i2c is up to and how it is structured, and that it allows us to build more connections between our projects and the broader community. Check out the new documentation landing site at

&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to making iterative improvements around the projects described above, we have a few major goals for the final quarter of 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>polish and finish the alpha-level deployment infrastructure&lt;/strong> across each of the major cloud providers. Our end goal is to be able to &lt;em>deploy a Kubernetes cluster and a JupyterHub on that cluster with minimal human effort&lt;/em>. This will allow us to serve more communities with fewer human effort per community. This includes migrating JupyterHubs for key communities, such as the Pangeo project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define and begin an alpha-level service&lt;/strong>. This means defining a few specific &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; that 2i2c can offer, as well as a pricing model for each product. Our goals will still be to learn about how this service should evolve, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more specificity about ways that others can engage with us. It will also be an opportunity to scale modestly so that we can improve our infrastructure as-needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define a longer-term vision&lt;/strong> for our Managed JupyterHubs Service, and create a plan for new workflows that we wish to enable via new development. We wish to use our experience in managing JupyterHubs to understand where new open source development would significantly help the communities we serve, and will shift our attention in this direction once we have finished the early stages of making our infrastructure more robust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for some more updates about this service, coming soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-weve-faced">
Challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-weve-faced">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we want to recognize that there are plenty of challenges along with successes when it comes to having impact! Here are a few of the unexpected challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve faced along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developing and operating multi-cloud infrastructure is a complex process&lt;/strong>. Automating the creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters across each of the major cloud providers has proven to be a lot of work! While it has been necessary to use our pre-existing hubs to provide the opportunity to build this infrastructure, it is a challenge to both &lt;em>build&lt;/em> and &lt;em>operate&lt;/em> infrastructure at the same time. This has lengthened our timelines for when we expect the alpha version of the service to be ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coordinating among a distributed team takes time&lt;/strong>. Each of our team members has been used to working asynchronously with open source communities for many years, and we under-estimated how complex it would be to port this workflow to a distributed team that must coordinate with each other much more closely on a daily basis. Deciding what to work on, how to work on it, and how to help one another take a lot of work when you only share a few hours awake at the same time. For this reason, we have spent a lot of extra energy in our first months as a team to work out
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team processes for coordination and collaboration&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to design cloud services as a non-profit?&lt;/strong> Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is no clear roadmap for how to build a sustainable cloud service like the one we describe here. 2i2c is somewhere in-between a traditional SaaS company (which tends to provide access to proprietary technology) and a bespoke consultancy (which is more hands-on and custom than we are). Our best explanation for what 2i2c wishes to do is &amp;ldquo;Open source operations/dev-ops as a service&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into either category. This means that we have more &amp;ldquo;unknown unknowns&amp;rdquo; about what kind of service and pricing model we should develop. We hope to begin answering some of these questions in our alpha-level service launch. Stay tuned for more to come!&lt;/p>

.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code for Science &amp;amp; Society is thrilled to welcome the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/a>
(2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project! After spending a year incubating in the
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>
, where 2i2c
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received critical startup support&lt;/a>
, 2i2c now joins our fiscally sponsored project program to launch their next phase. 2i2c develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing, with a focus on the Jupyter ecosystem and cloud-native workflows in research and education. They will build a cloud services model that respects a community’s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate their infrastructure&lt;/a>
by providing transparent and customizable JupyterHub deployments on cloud infrastructure that utilize community-driven open source tools. They aim to use the resources generated from this service in order to support the communities that underlie this infrastructure. Read on for more about 2i2c’s mission and how CS&amp;amp;S will support their team and vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c’s organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2c’s co-founders have co-led for many years, including
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder Project&lt;/a>
, and the
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/a>
. These projects follow an “integrate, customize, and upstream” model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CS&amp;amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS&amp;amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS&amp;amp;S’s other initiatives in this space, including CS&amp;amp;S’s other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the
&lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/cs-s-launches-digital-infrastructure-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Infrastructure Incubator program&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Achieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2c’s next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2c’s developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="../czi-core-support">funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>
).
In that time we&amp;rsquo;ve made progress along several directions, and wish to use this blog post to provide updates about the ways in which 2i2c has evolved over the first months of its existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few major updates from the 2i2c community - as always, if you want to learn more about 2i2c, keep an eye
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts">on our blog&lt;/a>

&lt;h2 id="early-pilot-jupyterhub-infrastructure">
Early pilot JupyterHub infrastructure
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#early-pilot-jupyterhub-infrastructure">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off - we have been making progress building out our JupyterHub deployment infrastructure for 2i2c.
One of our major organizational goals is to build a sustainable service
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure">managing open source cloud infrastructure&lt;/a>
for interactive computing.
This service will provide hosted, customized JupyterHubs for communities of practice in research and education.
They&amp;rsquo;ll be built entirely with open source tools that are community-driven, and that
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">respect the community&amp;rsquo;s Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to accomplish this, 2i2c is running several pilots with partners and interested organizations, supported by our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/czi-core-support">funding from CZI&lt;/a>
, as well as from
&lt;a href="https://investinopen.org/blog/jrost-rapid-response-fund-awardees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the JROST rapid response fund&lt;/a>
.
These pilots are meant to be learning opportunities to understand what kind of infrastructure and service it needs to build moving forward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">documentation for our pilot hubs infrastructure&lt;/a>
contains information about our deployments and infrastructure.
It is served from
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this &lt;code>2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/code> repository&lt;/a>
, a centralized location for configuring and deploying a federated network of JupyterHubs.
Each JupyterHub is independent of one another, and could be spun out from the centralized repository with minimal extra work, giving hub users the ability to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">replicate their infrastructure, with or without 2i2c&lt;/a>
.
We will continue refining the code in this repository as we learn more from our hub infrastructure pilots.&lt;/p>

JupyterHub for geospatial analytics - A collaboration with Pangeo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-for-geospatial-analytics---a-collaboration-with-pangeo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/pangeo/pangeo-2-0-2bedf099582d" target="_blank" rel="noopener">originally announced on the Pangeo blog&lt;/a>
, 2i2c is forging a collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo project&lt;/a>
around operating and developing cloud infrastructure for large-scale geospatial analytics!
This collaboration is funded through a grant from the Moore Foundation (via Pangeo investigator Ryan Abernathey).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the coming months, 2i2c plans to assume operation of infrastructure underlying the Pangeo project, allowing the Pangeo team to focus their efforts on their core scientific and development missions.
Because Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure is already running on a fully open source stack with JupyterHub, our first step will simply be to shift control over this infrastructure to 2i2c engineers.
We don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate needing to make major changes to their infrastructure and deployments (part of the benefits of using open, modular tools).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once this is complete, we&amp;rsquo;ll next shift our attention to some new areas of development that support use-cases in the Pangeo community (and in the scientific community more broadly).
There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of progress that we imagine making - such as
&lt;a href="https://gallery.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">supporting publishing pipelines via the Pangeo Gallery&lt;/a>
or improving tools for scalable computing with
&lt;a href="https://gateway.dask.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dask Gateway&lt;/a>
.
We&amp;rsquo;ll provide updates as we formally begin this collaboration and hash out a plan for our next steps.&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-for-education---a-collaboration-with-cloudbank-and-uc-berkeley">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership with the UC Berkeley
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/undergraduate-programs" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data Science in Undergraduate Studies program&lt;/a>
, as well as
&lt;a href="http://cloudbank.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudBank&lt;/a>
.
This collaboration aims to provide hosted JupyterHub infrastructure for community colleges across the state of California.
It is an attempt at providing vendor-agnostic and open-source infrastructure to several institutions who would otherwise not be able to deploy this infrastructure on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will provide the deployment and configuration architecture for this collaboration, working with
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/sean-morris-5847aa2b" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sean Morris&lt;/a>
in operating this educational infrastructure.
All of the cloud infrastructure for this pilot will be funded via CloudBank.
We will begin by offering environments that are modeled after
&lt;a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Data 8 course at UC Berkeley&lt;/a>
.
This is part of an effort to build a community of practice around Data Science education using open source tools.&lt;/p>

, and collaborate together on running our 2i2c Pilot Hub infrastructure.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a bit about each new team member.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/damianavila" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damián Avila&lt;/a>
. Damián has been a Jupyter core team member for many years now, and has done work across many different parts of the PyData stack (in particular,
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jupyter&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="http://bokeh.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bokeh&lt;/a>

, and
&lt;a href="https://getnikola.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nikola&lt;/a>
). Damián will focus his efforts on supporting JupyterHub infrastructure for the
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo project&lt;/a>
, as well as development across the
&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executable Books Project&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sgibson91" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Gibson&lt;/a>
. Sarah will join 2i2c in June, after spending several years as a Research Software Engineer at
&lt;a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Turing Institute&lt;/a>
. She has also been involved with
&lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Turing Way&lt;/a>
for many years. Sarah will focus her efforts on JupyterHub development and operations for the Pangeo community.&lt;/li>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, while it&amp;rsquo;s easy to get lost in technology and collaborations, 2i2c has also made important steps towards defining a stable and transparent organizational model moving forward.
2i2c now
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/about/structure.html#steering-council" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a Steering Council&lt;/a>
and an
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/about/structure.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early organizational structure&lt;/a>
.
In addition,
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we&amp;rsquo;ve defined a one-year bootstrap strategy&lt;/a>
that we&amp;rsquo;ll use to guide our path in the first year of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s existence.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, one of the first acts of the Steering Council has been to
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/code-of-conduct/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adopt a Code of Conduct&lt;/a>
.
This is a set of guidelines, and a process for resolving incidents, that makes our community more inclusive, equitable, and enjoyable for all.
Creating a Code of Conduct is a crucial part of defining our organizational and community culture, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to have some explicit guidelines to support our interactions in the future!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="keep-in-touch">
Keep in touch
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#keep-in-touch">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Now that we are improving our organizational foundation, we will try to post more frequent updates and discussions about what we are up to.
We hope for 2i2c to be a model organization in participatory, collaborative, transparent operations, and we look forward to working with you all in the future on this journey.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open Source Infrastructure Engineer: Pangeo Project</title><link>https://2i2c.org/jobs/2021/osie-pangeo/</link><pubDate>Wed, 09 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/jobs/2021/osie-pangeo/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are looking for an Open Source Infrastructure Engineer who will help shape the future of data-intensive scientific research and make a big impact on important problems shaping society.

Who we are
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#who-we-are">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a non-profit organization with a mission to make interactive computing more accessible, scalable, and powerful for research and education. We strive to&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Support data workflows in research and education through infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Support open tools and communities that underlie this infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We accomplish this mission by providing managed cloud services for interactive computing, by providing development and technical leadership to researchers and educators that utilize this infrastructure for specific communities, and by providing support for open source tools and communities in this ecosystem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have deep ties to the open source community, and have been leaders and core contributors across dozens of projects - in particular in the Jupyter ecosystem. We also have deep ties to research and education - our team has spent years deploying infrastructure for universities, community colleges, and research teams, and now we’re bringing this experience to a wider audience with 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe strongly in communities that are inclusive, transparent, equitable, effective, and diverse, especially 2i2c itself. We believe that our values should permeate everything about 2i2c, including the work we do, the communities we serve, and our own organizational culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is a project of the
&lt;a href="https://icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>

&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/hello-world/">announced the creation of 2i2c&lt;/a>
, a non-profit initiative dedicated to improving and facilitating access to infrastructure for interactive computing workflows in research and education. Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>
. You can find
&lt;a href="https://cziscience.medium.com/scaling-open-infrastructure-and-reproducibility-in-biomedicine-69546a399747" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZI&amp;rsquo;s announcement here&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of this post is a short run-down of what we&amp;rsquo;ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-big-picture">
The big picture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-big-picture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In recent years, several projects including
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy&lt;/a>
, and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Berkeley DataHubs&lt;/a>
have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are two keys goals for this grant:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">
Goal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/chris-holdgraf">Chris Holdgraf&lt;/a>
to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">
Goal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c will offer hosted
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure">interactive computing infrastructure&lt;/a>
utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first hire -
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/georgiana-dolocan">Georgiana Dolocan&lt;/a>
as an &lt;strong>Open Source Infrastructure Engineer&lt;/strong>. Georgiana has been the
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/the-jupyterhub-and-binder-contributor-in-residence-56708d1e3069" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub Contributor in Residence&lt;/a>
for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Georgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/outreachy-jupyter-supporting-diversity-in-open-communities-dfa78db4b0bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an outreachy internship&lt;/a>
followed by
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/cir-report-i-1ca418c230cd" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a term as Contributor in Residence&lt;/a>
. Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the
&lt;a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Berkeley Institute for Data Science&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://numfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NumFOCUS&lt;/a>
for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZI EOSS grant series&lt;/a>
for funding the original Contributor in Residence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure/#kinds-of-hubs">JupyterHub pilot deployments&lt;/a>
to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please
&lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">reach out to 2i2c&lt;/a>
and let us know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally. We also believe it will lead to major advancements in supporting interactive computing workflows for research and education. We look forward to what the next three years will bring!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>👋 hey everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the creation of a new non-profit organization&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that we call &lt;strong>2i2c&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c stands for &lt;strong>The International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/strong>. It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="why-create-2i2c">
Why create 2i2c?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-create-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/founders#datahub">bringing data science education to thousands of students&lt;/a>
, connecting
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/founders#pangeo">geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud&lt;/a>
, and providing
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/founders#syzygy">federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada&lt;/a>
, to name a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that &lt;em>development&lt;/em> and &lt;em>support&lt;/em> of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-non-profit">
Why a non-profit?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-a-non-profit">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It may sound strange to create a non-profit initiative when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research and educational communities&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Researchers and educators who need development&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that offers development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source communities&lt;/strong>, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud providers&lt;/strong>, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supporters of open source&lt;/strong> who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-going-to-do">
What are we going to do?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-we-going-to-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here&amp;rsquo;s a rough picture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Offer
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure">&lt;strong>hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
. These will

and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They&amp;rsquo;ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate">the 2i2c &lt;strong>Right to Replicate&lt;/strong> document&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/infrastructure#research-development-hubs">&lt;strong>collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
. Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community&amp;rsquo;s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/#jupyter">&lt;strong>core development and community support&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
for open source projects that we use. While many organizations &lt;em>use&lt;/em> Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they &lt;em>give back&lt;/em> to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-steps">
Next steps
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#next-steps">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months. Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be up to next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first step is to &lt;strong>understand how interactive computing can best-serve the research and education communities&lt;/strong>. We know that interactive computing tools work in our specific use-cases, but how do these generalize to other domains or types of organizations? Moreover, how can we improve the open source tools to make them even more customizable for each community?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll begin answering this question through several focused JupyterHub pilots aimed at different use-cases across research and education:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A &amp;ldquo;Hubs for All&amp;rdquo; pilot for education&lt;/strong>. This will focus on making standard educational environments via JupyterHub accessible to a broad range of educational institutions, in particular, traditionally under-resourced institutions such as community colleges, state colleges, and HBCUs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research-focused hubs for earth analytics&lt;/strong>. Research requires more complex and customized infrastructure than education, and so we are piloting hub infrastructure for a few specific research communities to understand how we can meet their needs. We will use this to better-understand how 2i2c and support a diverse research community in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JupyterHub development for the Pangeo Project&lt;/strong>. Pangeo has been a collaborator of 2i2c since day one, and we love its vision for large-scale earth analytics via cloud infrastructure. We plan to work closely with Pangeo leadership to work on early development of tools aimed at facilitating scalable computing for research on Pangeo infrastructure. More information about this to come soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll also use these pilots to &lt;strong>develop an organizational sustainability model&lt;/strong> around this infrastructure. It takes expertise to manage and develop cloud infrastructure, and 2i2c wishes to pay market rates for its engineers. How can 2i2c offer services and development in a way that is sustainable both for itself and for other institutions? We&amp;rsquo;ll use these pilots to create a plan for both sustaining and scaling 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s ability to serve institutions and teams.&lt;/p>

What do we need?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-we-need">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c has a long road ahead of it. We cannot take venture capital funding, so we have to raise funds the old-fashioned way. This means that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are at an organization interested in purchasing hosted JupyterHub environments from 2i2c, please
&lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are a funder or are otherwise interested in supporting 2i2c with a donation or grant, please
&lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have experience in sustaining service-based organizations such as 2i2c, and wish to offer your expertise or guidance, please
&lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ll likely be hiring in the coming months for open source engineers, with a focus on data science, interactive computing, and the cloud. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working for an organization like 2i2c, please
&lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>
, and keep an eye on this space as we will post more information soon.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a community&amp;rsquo;s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c. We make these commitments because we believe that using infrastructure that follows these principles will lead to a more fair, just, equitable world. We also believe they are the right foundation for more productive and impactful research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is committed to running its own infrastructure on open-source tools and vendor-agnostic infrastructure, though it does not &lt;em>force&lt;/em> users to use only open-source tools in their own environments, code, and data. Below is a table describing how the Right to Replicate fits into 2i2c hub technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(Definitions of &lt;code>MUST&lt;/code>, &lt;code>MUST NOT&lt;/code>, &lt;code>SHOULD&lt;/code>, &lt;code>MAY&lt;/code>, etc are defined in

&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Below we describe our commitments in our own infrastructure stack in more detail.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-2i2c-infrastructure-ensures-this-right">
How 2i2c infrastructure ensures this right
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-2i2c-infrastructure-ensures-this-right">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c infrastructure and documentation for it MUST BE as transparent &amp;amp; accessible as possible, so communities can replicate our configuration without having to extract any ‘secret sauce’ from 2i2c. If they choose to, they can also inspect, audit &amp;amp; modify the infrastructure they are paying for and using.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To ensure the Right to Replicate to our communities, 2i2c makes the following commitments to infrastructure we build and operate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We MUST use only open source software to run our infrastructure. By only using software that is available to everyone on the same terms, we can ensure that communities can replicate the infrastructure without having to negotiate licensing terms with proprietary software vendors. In addition, any changes we make to open source software will be made in public and/or contributed upstream, so communities continue to have access to them regardless of where their infrastructure is.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We MUST NOT directly depend on proprietary cloud vendor specific products or APIs. Instead, we use cloud-managed open source software, or hide the dependency behind a layer of abstraction. This ensures that communities can port their infrastructure to any cloud provider of their choice, or run it on their own hardware with purely open source software.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This set of commitments acts as a business continuity plan for our partner communities, ensuring 2i2c will follow best practices within the open source, open education and open research ecosystems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2i2c managed JupyterHubs</title><link>https://2i2c.org/service/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/service/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Collaborate with 2i2c</title><link>https://2i2c.org/collaborate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/collaborate/</guid><description>&lt;p>2i2c has expertise in cloud infrastructure and managed services for interactive computing in research and education workflows.
