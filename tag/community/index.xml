JupyterHub: A multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-a-multi-user-server-for-jupyter-notebooks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is how JupyterHub was described when it was announced in 2015, 10 years ago. The focus was on bringing Jupyter Notebooks to multiple users on shared infrastructure. The Jupyter Notebooks focus was so strong that Jupyter was even in the name of the project! Fast forward 10 years, &amp;amp; this is still the most common perception of JupyterHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this has not been true for a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> time now. Instead of setting up 5 different kinds of infrastructure to support your users based on what kind of &lt;em>interface&lt;/em> they like to use (
&lt;a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterLab&lt;/a>,

&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Visual Studio Code&lt;/a>, full &lt;code>ssh&lt;/code> (!?), etc) for their interactive computing, you can set up a JupyterHub that supports all of those! Meet your users where they are, rather than force them to conform to using only a specific set of tools.&lt;/p>

Cloudy with a Chance of Savings: Per-User Usage and Cost Monitoring for JupyterHubs in the Cloud
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cloudy-with-a-chance-of-savings-per-user-usage-and-cost-monitoring-for-jupyterhubs-in-the-cloud">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cloud cost monitoring is moving beyond just preventing runaway cost explosions – it&amp;rsquo;s about empowering JupyterHub administrators with the guardrails they need to run efficient, transparent, and sustainable infrastructures. A cloud cost bill can show a broad view of services and machines provisioned, but how can we provide granular insights into each user and the value they are deriving from the hub on an application level?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve developed several open-source components towards answering this question:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Metric Collection&lt;/strong> –
&lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Prometheus&lt;/a> collects resource usage metrics (including CPU, memory, and storage) from individual user pods via standard and custom exporters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cost Estimation&lt;/strong> – Usage is correlated with AWS cost data to estimate per-user costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Visualization&lt;/strong> –
&lt;a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Grafana&lt;/a> dashboards display rich, interactive views of usage and cost data, making it easy to monitor trends, identify high-cost workloads, and generate reports for funders and decision-makers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This approach delivers cloud observability and cost transparency that can be reliably deployed using
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kubernetes&lt;/a> and integrated with
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Zero to JupyterHub&lt;/a> distributions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="controlling-home-directory-costs-with-user-empathy-on-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-home-nfs">
Controlling home directory costs (with user empathy) on the cloud with jupyterhub-home-nfs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#controlling-home-directory-costs-with-user-empathy-on-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-home-nfs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>User home directories on JupyterHubs deployed in cloud providers has been a pain point for both end users and administrators. Administrators feel the pain of cloud costs for home directory storage (sometimes higher than compute!). No user wants to receive an email saying &amp;ldquo;well, this code you copy pasted downloaded 3TB of netcdf files into your home directory, and now we have used up our entire team&amp;rsquo;s cloud budget for the next 2 years&amp;rdquo; (true story).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-home-nfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/a> open source project is a JupyterHub native, cloud agnostic solution to these problems. Administrators can do per user limits, tune performance, report on usage and make cloud cost conscious choices around overprovisioning. It provides users empathetic guardrails to prevent them from overuse, rather than punitive gates that zap them after the fact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this short talk, we will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Describe the core of the problem, and how it manifests for users and admins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Review current solutions and their limitations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce jupyterhub-home-nfs and how it moves the solution space forward&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Demo how this looks like for an end user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk about future direction, and opportunities for collaboration&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Have you stopped using mybinder.org for your tutorials, repositories and presentations because you could no longer rely on it to work each time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>mybinder.org is open infrastructure run by incredible volunteers (who go above and beyond constantly) in the Jupyter community. Is &amp;lsquo;slow fade into unreliability&amp;rsquo; just the fate of all openly run infrastructure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But perhaps maybe, just maybe, you have tried doing that again recently, &amp;amp; noticed improvements! Launches are more reliable. Faster. The UI looks better. Maybe things are getting better?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk will go through the problems facing mybinder.org &amp;amp; what we are doing about it. Come to this talk to find out:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How is mybinder.org run?&lt;/li>

&lt;p>&lt;code>jupyterhub-simulator&lt;/code> is an open source project that allows you to describe what you expect your users to be doing - starting servers, clicking on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> links, running notebooks, etc. Once you have described it, you can then simulate any number of users doing that workflow simultaneously, and verify that your JupyterHub can handle that workload. If it can&amp;rsquo;t, tweak your infrastructure and try again until it does!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this talk you will learn:&lt;/p>

&lt;li>What is &lt;code>jupyterhub-simulator&lt;/code>?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can I describe my expected workflow?&lt;/li>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Open source communities can be incredible and irreplaceable sources of human connection in our lives, offering a unique kind of fulfillment hard to find elsewhere. This feeling of fulfillment and approval can, for some people, be a soothing balm in an otherwise rough life. However, it has the be part of a healthy, balanced ecosystem of different kinds of connections offering different kinds of fulfillment . If a significant chunk of fulfillment in your life comes from the open source work you do, unbalanced by other sources, that can quickly become unhealthy for both you and the community. Disagreements are more likely to become high stakes. Interactions can quickly become emotionally charged and filled with hard to interpret subtext. This can both burn you out, and drive away potential new community members.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk explores the why &lt;em>emotional regulation&lt;/em> is a critical skill for participating in open source communities, and how therapy can be a tool for learning that skill. Come to learn:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What is &lt;em>emotional regulation&lt;/em>?&lt;/li>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-2i2c-has-learned-while-trying-to-build-sustainable-relationships-with-jupyters-community">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a non-profit organization that fosters co-creation and collaboration between science communities and open source communities. We are deeply embedded in an international network of research and education communities, as well as open source communities that underlie their infrastructure (particularly in the Jupyter ecosystem). Our technical infrastructure is built entirely with open source components that we contribute to, but do not control. This is a really hard problem to solve!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot in the first four years of our existence. This talk will describe how our organization approaches a healthy and productive open source relationship with the Jupyter (and broader scientific python) ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;ll cover some of the major mistakes we&amp;rsquo;ve made, lessons learned, and where we think we&amp;rsquo;ve had impact. We aim to make this talk full of practical learnings that others can follow in building sustainable open science organizations that contribute to a healthy and vibrant open source ecosystem. Our goal will be to provide inspiration to others that are interested in building on top of open source projects like Jupyter, and want to do so in a way that is healthy and sustainable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Solving classes of problems, rather than just an instance of a problem (with an example)</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/automating-support-upgrades/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jun 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/automating-support-upgrades/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="the-problem">
The Problem
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-problem">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Two of our the communities we serve (
&lt;a href="https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NMFS Openscapes&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://book.cryointhecloud.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a>) reported issues with starting GPU nodes on their hubs. Upon investigation, I discovered that the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cluster autoscaler&lt;/a> seems to not recognize that GPUs were available in the cluster at all suddenly, and hence wasn&amp;rsquo;t provisioning the nodes. A restart of the cluster-autoscaler pod fixed the issue for both these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="an-incomplete-solution">
An incomplete solution
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#an-incomplete-solution">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But is that the end of the story? Not if we want to provide reliable long term infrastructure to communities with minimal
&lt;a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >toil&lt;/a> on the part of 2i2c engineers!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the engineering principles I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have us more intentionally and structurally embody is the idea that we don&amp;rsquo;t fix individual instances of problems, but &lt;strong>whole classes of problems, rather than just an individual instance of the problem&lt;/strong>. Fixing the immediate issue is &lt;em>not enough&lt;/em> - we need to understand what &lt;strong>class of issues&lt;/strong> was manifesting itself in this particular fashion, and fix &lt;em>that&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-was-the-class-of-issues-we-could-fix-here">
What was the &lt;strong>class of issues&lt;/strong> we could fix here?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-was-the-class-of-issues-we-could-fix-here">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Digging in, I realized that our version of cluster-autoscaler was a little behind and not the latest. I &lt;em>presumed&lt;/em> this was a bug in cluster-autoscaler (given a restart fixed it, implying it is a bug about state). To me, the &lt;em>class of problem&lt;/em> here is that we were not rolling out releases to our &amp;ldquo;supporting infrastructure&amp;rdquo; fast enough. Perhaps if we were on the most recent cluster-autoscaler release, this issue would have never happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, this failure to scale up was reported to us by the community rather than by an automated alert. We should change that too!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="structured-solutions">
Structured solutions
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#structured-solutions">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We follow a two week sprint cycle, and I love the (hard won) structure it provides us. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to arbitrarily start doing work that upsets prior committed work from that structure. However, we also treat support requests seriously and try to work them into the sprint. So I timeboxed myself for one hour, and saw what I could accomplish. Turns out, a lot!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/6183" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >upgraded all our support components&lt;/a>, tested them, and rolled them out to &lt;em>all&lt;/em> our communities! This included upgrading Grafana, Prometheus, nginx-ingress as well as the cluster-autoscaler. This also restarts the cluster-autoscaler across our clusters, fixing this issue for other communities (if any had it).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >re-enabled&lt;/a> the automatic once a month PR for upgrading these support tasks. We had switched to doing them on a manual sprint cadence, but clearly that was not fast enough nor automated enough. We will instead work these into the sprint once the bot opens the PR. Credit to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Erik Sundell&lt;/a> for initially setting this up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/6185" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an issue&lt;/a> to track the alert creation, and put it in our sprint backlog.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(In an additional fifteen minute timebox) Write this blog post, to communicate out both to the affected communities and others what we have done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>By timeboxing myself, I didn&amp;rsquo;t upset our sprint cadence and was able to continue doing other work I had committed to in the sprint, while also fixing this &lt;em>class of issues&lt;/em> to the best of my ability.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While we have been &lt;em>implicitly&lt;/em> trying to solve whole classes of issues rather than individual instances of an issue as a team for a while, I want us to &lt;em>explicitly&lt;/em> do it from now on. Communicating this out to our communities is an important part of that, as is internal team training. This blog post is the former, and we are continually working on the latter :)&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/project-jupyters-2025-executive-council-elections-605b183ec64c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >recently elected to Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s Executive Council&lt;/a>. The 2i2c team discussed whether Chris should run for this position last year, and concluded that it was a way for our non-profit to both support Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s mission at a strategic level, and represent the interests of research and education communities in Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s direction. Chris wrote
&lt;a href="https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2025/jupyter-org-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a blog post about his reasons for running&lt;/a> with more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of Chris&amp;rsquo; goals is to be a transparent source of information about what the council is working on, where its priorities lie, and what are the major challenges it is trying to tackle. He&amp;rsquo;s written two blog posts that describe some of his experiences so far, at the links below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re hopeful that this is a way for 2i2c to scale its impact and lean into its
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/open-technology/" >commitment to open technology&lt;/a>. Chris intends to keep writing about his personal experience via
&lt;a href="https://chrisholdgraf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >his blog&lt;/a>, and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide updates here for major developments that are relevant to 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s network of communities.
We&amp;rsquo;re proud to have Chris in this role, and excited for his contributions to the Jupyter community!&lt;/p>

A diversity of team experiences helps us deliver a service that broadens and empowers participation in open-source science for all communities and leads to
&lt;a href="https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >more effective teams that make better decisions&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a young and growing organization, we have had mixed success in building diversity within our team.
We&amp;rsquo;ve leaned into the values of our service that build trust and attract a broad coalition of community partners (and potential employees).
For example, we&amp;rsquo;ve used the following pillars in describing our service:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Transparency&lt;/strong> – our transparent and participatory model keeps our incentives aligned with community needs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Empowerment&lt;/strong> – our service gives communities agency to design the service they need, and to manage it without 2i2c if they wish.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Partnership&lt;/strong> – our communities are partners working towards shared impact, not customers to grow revenue.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Sustainability&lt;/strong> – our service should have a self-sustaining model that ensures continuity, growth, and funder independence.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve also invested in creating an inclusive organizational culture via documents like
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our Team Compass&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/code-of-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our Code of Conduct&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. We&amp;rsquo;ve experimented with inclusive hiring practices to encourage a diverse pool of applicants for our open positions, such as
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >running open office hours for job postings&lt;/a> in the hopes that this would encourage more people to apply who might otherwise have been hesitant (something that often correlates with people from historically marginalized communities).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-importance-of-diverse-_leadership_">
The importance of diverse &lt;em>leadership&lt;/em>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-importance-of-diverse-_leadership_">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>However, over the past few months, we have reflected on our organization&amp;rsquo;s structure and future plans. In particular, we recognize that there is a worrying lack of women in staff leadership roles. This imbalance does not live up to our values of diversity in our team and service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to do better.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is at a moment of maturation and growth as an organization, kicked off by
&lt;a href="" >our organizational audit from 2023&lt;/a> as well as
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/report-czi/" >our three-year retrospective&lt;/a>.
We believe that improving the diversity of leadership throughout the organization is a necessary part of that maturation over the next three years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are a few ideas for how we aim to make improvements, and we invite feedback from others who are interested in helping us improve this aspect of our organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-we-plan-to-do">
What we plan to do
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-we-plan-to-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the next few months, we will work on a long-term DEI strategy in tandem with our sustainability strategy as we work
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-community-networks/" >towards scalable and sustainable networks of community hubs&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some steps we aim to take to improve the diversity of our leadership across the organization:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define our goals for diversity&lt;/strong>. First, we need a better understanding of the most important axes of diversity that we wish to design around. Gender is clearly a critical gap to cover, but there are many other important axes of diversity as well. For example, as an organization that serves a global community, it is important that we have global perspectives represented in our leadership.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define mechanisms for leadership and governance that includes representation along these axes&lt;/strong>. Leadership at a staff level is one way to ensure representation of diverse perspectives, but there are many other ways to bring voices into the conversation. We aim to explore new ways of bringing diverse voices into the strategic direction of the organization and provide mechanisms for holding us accountable to our values. For example, we intend to grow a &lt;em>board&lt;/em> to guide 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s strategy and hold its Executive Director accountable for achieving impact - this is another opportunity to bring diverse perspectives into our leadership.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make a plan for improving leadership diversity within our team&lt;/strong>. Whatever mechanisms we create for diverse leadership, we know that one of them needs to be improving our diversity at a staff leadership level. Our staff are the ones that spend the most time working on - and have the most leverage over - our strategy and mission, and it&amp;rsquo;s important that our staff leadership is a good representation of the diverse perspectives of the communities we serve. This might mean investing more heavily in reaching broad applicant pools for new positions, seeking external consultation for how we can avoid unintentionally sending exclusionary signals to others in our communications and outreach and developing incentives to retain our talent over time.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Continue improving our systems of delivery and work&lt;/strong>. Finally, we believe that a crucial aspect of improving the diversity in our organization is to continue transforming our systems for delivery, reliability, and accountability across the organization. This effort is a crucial step for fostering an inclusive and equitable culture. We have
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/delivery-improvements/" >made a lot of progress in improving our delivery systems&lt;/a> and will continue this improvement as an organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We hope that this post both makes transparent a distinct lack of diversity within our organizational leadership and provides clarity for some of our plans to improve.
We are excited about the organization that we have built so far, as well as being fiercely proud of our open-source culture and development practises.
We still know that we must do better, and we&amp;rsquo;re fully committed to doing so over the coming years.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="" >our 2023 report of organizational strengths and weaknesses&lt;/a>, describing some improvements we&amp;rsquo;ve made on our team&amp;rsquo;s coordination and delivery&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2023, we
&lt;a href="" >released a report describing our organizational strengths and weaknesses&lt;/a>.
This uncovered a key challenge for our team: &lt;strong>improving our coordination and delivery&lt;/strong>.
Over the previous two years, our service had grown significantly in its scope and complexity.
We were working on more than 7 active grants and were serving more than 70 active communities with around 7,000 monthly active users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was taxing our small team, and we found ourselves struggling to efficiently deliver on our work.
For example, a
&lt;a href="" >collaboration with GESIS to bring image building functionality to JupyterHub&lt;/a> took longer than we wished, and we felt that our planning and execution was not transparent enough to their team. In addition, in
&lt;a href="https://catalystproject.cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/a> we felt that 2i2c was not responsive enough to onboarding and deploying infrastructure for new communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-weve-taken-to-improve-delivery">
Steps we&amp;rsquo;ve taken to improve delivery
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#steps-weve-taken-to-improve-delivery">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At the beginning of 2024, we hired
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" >our first Delivery Manager and Chief of Staff role&lt;/a> as well as
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" >our first Product Lead role&lt;/a>.
Both of these roles are meant to develop systems and team practices that improve our planning and delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Quarter 1 of 2024, we designed and initiated an organizational transformation with the following goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Provide clarity about our overall organizational goals and strategy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define our near-term goals and major projects that drive our work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define and prioritize the major work items that feed into these goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break this major work items into actionable items that our team can work on from day to day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide visibility for all of this information across the entire organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Below is a brief description of the major changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve made.
These are still a work in progress, and organizational transformation takes months, if not years, but we hope that this provides a useful snapshot in time as we kick off this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-system-of-work">
Our system of work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-system-of-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our team-wide system of work can be found in the Team Compass at the link below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/cross-functional/workflow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >compass.2i2c.org/cross-functional/workflow/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system of work attempts to link our strategic goals with concrete chunks of work to deliver.
You can see an overview of this system below:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-our-work-system-shows-how-initiatives-are-made-up-of-lists-of-actions-that-accomplish-them-these-actions-are-distributed-across-our-teams-operational-boards-for-delivery">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img alt="Our work system shows how initiatives are made up of lists of actions that accomplish them. These actions are distributed across our team&amp;#39;s operational boards for delivery."
src="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/delivery-improvements/system.svg"
loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Our work system shows how initiatives are made up of lists of actions that accomplish them. These actions are distributed across our team&amp;rsquo;s operational boards for delivery.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It is roughly broken down into these major areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our value proposition&lt;/strong>: Our system of delivery starts with a value proposition.
This is a north-star statement for the value that 2i2c aims to provide to our communities in order to achieve our mission.
It is a guiding principle for where we prioritize our time and improve our service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While updating our delivery model, we decided it was time to update the value proposition we&amp;rsquo;d been informally using.
We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of &lt;em>validating this value proposition with communities&lt;/em>, and will share a draft for public comment soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strategic goals and major projects&lt;/strong>: Next we define strategic goals that describe the most important progress we must make as an organization.
This considers our current capabilities and challenges, as well as the major projects that we&amp;rsquo;re already committed to (like grants).
Our initiatives (described below) should each represent progress towards one or more of our goals and major projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strategic initiatives&lt;/strong>: These are major thrusts of work that represent progress towards our goals.
They range in time from weeks to months, and generally require coordination and action across each of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s functional areas.
Initiatives exist in a dedicated board, where we shape and scope them with enough information to understand them and prioritize.
Once an initiative is in progress, it begins driving work on a two-week planning cycle.
All in-progress initiatives should make up a significant percentage of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s total work allocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Operational boards&lt;/strong>: Operational boards are used to track our day-to-day workstreams.
We organize into two-week sprints, with a collection of work pulled into each sprint according to in-progress initiatives and the other types of reactive and operational work on our plate (for example, responding to support tickets is reactive work).
Within each initiative, we coordinate across our teams in order to understand the next steps needed and who is responsible for doing it.
This helps teams plan the work for their next iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system is very much still a work in progress, and we&amp;rsquo;ve already identified a number of ways that we&amp;rsquo;d like to improve it moving forward.
For example, we&amp;rsquo;d like to find more efficient ways of coordinating across our team, and encouraging team members to own their own work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="changes-to-our-team-culture">
Changes to our team culture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#changes-to-our-team-culture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to our system around planning work, we&amp;rsquo;ve also identified a number of ways that we can improve our team&amp;rsquo;s culture related to work.
As a distributed organization, one of our biggest challenges has been the additional friction that comes with communicating across many time zones.
It&amp;rsquo;s much harder to solve a problem or get help when responses come with long gaps of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, we&amp;rsquo;ve defined several practices that will help our team members grow their autonomy and independence, while still moving towards the same targets and goals.
This is ongoing work that we aim to continue developing over the next few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Professional growth&lt;/strong>.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ve started an audit of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational roles and the responsibilities and the pathways for growth with each of them.
This began with our engineering team, but will continue with other areas of the organization as well.
We believe that defining professional growth trajectories will help identify the gaps in our team&amp;rsquo;s skills that make it more difficult to act efficiently and independently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Giving and receiving feedback&lt;/strong>.
We&amp;rsquo;ve defined team practices around giving feedback, and are encouraging a team culture of regular and constructive feedback to one another.
We know that this will be a long-term investment in team practices, and we believe that any team (especially a distributed one) must be able to rely on its team members to help one another grow.
We&amp;rsquo;ve begun this effort by
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/operations/team-practices/feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >creating a guide to giving feedback for 2i2c&lt;/a> which we hope will be useful for others as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Decision making&lt;/strong>.
We&amp;rsquo;ve defined a
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/operations/governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >set of principles around decision making at 2i2c&lt;/a> that encourage more autonomy and creativity.
In a knowledge-driven field such as ours, it is important that team members have the freedom to be creative and take risks, and that we design systems that are resilient to mistakes.
We aim to make mistakes &lt;em>Safe to Fail&lt;/em> to encourage creativity and learning while de-risking major negative consequences.
This document is a first step towards improving our team-wide practices at taking more initiative and action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Iterative delivery and process improvement&lt;/strong>.
Across each level of the organisation, we have been experimenting more deliberately with Agile delivery practices. These experiments shape our approach to planning (at both the team and organization-level), visualizing and managing our work streams, and improving our internal product delivery processes. We are agnostic to a specific Agile framework, and have found the most value in blending elements of
&lt;a href="https://asana.com/resources/what-is-kanban" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kanban&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Scrum&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://flightlevels.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Flight levels&lt;/a>. We will continue to experiment with these practices, seeking to find a happy medium for 2i2c. We&amp;rsquo;ll share more on this soon :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coaching&lt;/strong>.
Some members of our team have also begun benefiting from having regular 1:1 coaching to help their interpersonal development. Our team&amp;rsquo;s coaching support includes work to empower improving self-awareness, overcoming self-limiting challenges and gaining technical leadership mastery.
Coupled with our growing practices around team feedback, we aim to build a culture where team members have both internal and external support to help them grow.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are still in the early days of this transformation. We hope that these practices will improve both our operational efficiency and also create a more enjoyable work environment where team members are empowered to have impact in the ways that they see best. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to lean into these challenges and grow as a team, because this is how we can grow the impact of 2i2c and deliver more value for the communities that we serve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Principles and considerations for ethically accepting funding for open source</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/open-source-funding-principles/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/open-source-funding-principles/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This is a brainstorm to consider the principles and guidelines that 2i2c should follow in defining its strategy towards open source communities.
See
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our open source policy documentation&lt;/a> for the product of this brainstorm.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past year the 2i2c team has focused its efforts on deploying, configuring, running, and managing cloud infrastructure that supports open source workflows in research and education. We&amp;rsquo;ve also done a lot of &lt;em>upstream contribution&lt;/em> as a part of our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, we have shied away from taking direct funding for direct development work in open source projects. This is for two primary reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Our focus has been on managing cloud infrastructure, not developing it. We want to facilitate access to open workflows in interactive computing, which is a different skillset and kind of work than &lt;em>creating&lt;/em> those tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>While 2i2c is aligned with the interests of open communities, we are still a distinct organization with our own mission and strategy. We want to be conscious that 2i2c team members have &lt;em>more than one hat&lt;/em>, and that their 2i2c hat is necessarily not the same thing as their open source hat. As such, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to leverage our &amp;ldquo;other hats&amp;rdquo; to drive resources to 2i2c without being thoughtful about it.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In the last year we&amp;rsquo;ve found that running infrastructure for research and education gives us great visibility into the kinds of things that these communities want to do, and ways to improve the infrastructure. It also means we can potentially be a conduit of &lt;em>resources&lt;/em> from those communities into open source development workflows. For example, we recently
&lt;a href="" >partnered with GESIS to make improvements in Binder and JupyterHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, this post is a brainstorm to identify some of the major considerations that we should take before agreeing to this kind of work. Its goals is to drive policy that streamlines our ability to seek and accept funding for open source work. It tries to answer this question:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>How can a stakeholder accept funding on behalf of an open source community in a way that is inclusive, equitable, and effective.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="some-assumptions">
Some assumptions
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#some-assumptions">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off I want to note that this only applies to open source projects that I&amp;rsquo;d call &amp;ldquo;Open communities&amp;rdquo;. For example, those that follow
&lt;a href="https://openscholarlyinfrastructure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the principles of open scholarly infrastructure&lt;/a>. The ideas here don&amp;rsquo;t apply to open source projects that are run by single organizations or people. You can assume I&amp;rsquo;m talking about projects that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Have inclusive multi-stakeholder governance and operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Care about having a broad contributor and leadership base, and want to follow best-practices in inclusive and equitable operations.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Need funding to drive major new efforts, or to sustain pre-existing maintenance and community management work.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Why is this important? In short, because open projects should care about good governance, and about building sustainable and diverse multi-stakeholder communities around their operations and strategy. While it&amp;rsquo;s easy to ignore these considerations and just bring in money however you can (open source is perpetually under-funded, after all), it&amp;rsquo;s crucial that we think about how to do so in a way that aligns with the values of open communities, and that doesn&amp;rsquo;t simply propagate a &amp;ldquo;rich get richer&amp;rdquo; dynamic. Ultimately, the unique value of open communities is not in the technology they create, but in the &lt;em>way that they create it&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tldr-an-overview-of-major-considerations">
&lt;code>tl;dr&lt;/code>: An overview of major considerations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#tldr-an-overview-of-major-considerations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After working with several open source projects over the years, there are a few issues that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen come up again and again. Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick summary and I&amp;rsquo;ll note each in more detail below.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Governance&lt;/strong>: funding should &lt;em>follow&lt;/em> major decisions, not make them. It should represent the interests of the project rather than those of a single stakeholder or payer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Transparency&lt;/strong>: stakeholders that accept funding should be transparent in their &lt;em>accounting&lt;/em> (the sources of funding, deliverables attached with it, and operational costs), their &lt;em>plans&lt;/em> (the work they plan to do and how they want to do it) and in their &lt;em>strategy&lt;/em> (the reason they&amp;rsquo;re applying for funding in the first place, and how the work fits in with their other operations).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Accountability&lt;/strong>: stakeholders that accept funding should be accountable to the open communities that they are supporting. There should be mechanisms for open communities to provide feedback about and influence their operations, ideally in a powerful position like a board seat.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Equity&lt;/strong>: funding should be shared with others in the project, particularly those that need it or that couldn&amp;rsquo;t get funding on their own. Moreover, people should be paid for their time - if funding requires work from others, they should be compensated somehow.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Inclusion&lt;/strong>: funding &lt;em>opportunities&lt;/em> should be shared with others in a project, particularly those from historically disadvantaged communities. Stakeholders with funding &amp;ldquo;connections&amp;rdquo; should use them to boost others in the community as &lt;em>partners&lt;/em>, not just as contractors&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here is a more in-depth discussion of each below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="governance-funding-should-follow-decisions">
Governance: funding should follow decisions
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#governance-funding-should-follow-decisions">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As a general rule, &lt;strong>funding should not be a decision&lt;/strong>, it should only be fuel that helps &lt;strong>execute a decision that has already been made&lt;/strong> by the community. Moreover, responsibilities attached to funding should only be given to people with the power to actually carry them out.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The most common mistake that I&amp;rsquo;ve seen in open communities is when funding &lt;em>creates&lt;/em> an unintended decision on behalf of many others.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, a new funder shows up with an agenda and offers it to a subset of maintainers. Those maintainers accept, implicitly making a decision to do the bidding of the funder (this could be a grant, a contract, etc). They begin doing the work, and run into resistance from &lt;em>other&lt;/em> maintainers who weren&amp;rsquo;t on-board with these changes in the first place. This creates a stressful situation where one party has legally committed to doing some work, but they may not have the buy-in from others in the community to let it happen. This is particularly problematic when the funding commitment was not advertised publicly to others in the project early on.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to ensure that funding is aligned with good governance principles:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make it clear who is allowed to accept money for a project&lt;/strong>. First and foremost, projects should be explicit about who is allowed to accept money that involves doing open source work for them (e.g., only steering council members can approve new funding). Moreover, they should define basic policies about how that money can be used (e.g. does the project have a cap on the amount that can be paid to individuals).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tell others about your funding opportunity and get buy-in.&lt;/strong> If a stakeholder wants to take advantage of a funding opportunity, they should first tell others on the team about the opportunity and what they hope to do. This is the bare minimum - give others an opportunity to object to your plan and/or ask for clarifications or modifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make decisions before funding opportunities arise&lt;/strong>. If the community has already agreed that something is a good idea, then it is much simpler if funding simply helps &lt;em>implement&lt;/em> something rather than &lt;em>propose&lt;/em> something new.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="transparency--make-it-easy-for-others-to-see-your-interests-and-operations">
Transparency: make it easy for others to see your interests and operations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#transparency--make-it-easy-for-others-to-see-your-interests-and-operations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Most open projects are community-led, while funding tends to be awarded to one or more stakeholders &lt;em>within&lt;/em> that community. At a minimum, communities should ask stakeholders to provide transparency about why they&amp;rsquo;re looking for funding, what they&amp;rsquo;re agreeing to do, and how they spend the money.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Transparency is a way of building trust with other stakeholders by being clear about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to. It makes it easier for others to hold you accountable, and makes it easier for others to understand whether your actions are in line with the goals and values of the community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Share your budget with the community&lt;/strong>. Money is always a sensitive subject, but communities have a right to know if funding is being spent towards roles and operations that align with their interests. Some communities may also have policies about how much funding can be awarded to an individual person, and making this clear (even if it is in aggregate) helps others understand what you&amp;rsquo;re doing with funds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Declare conflicts of interest&lt;/strong>. We all have multiple hats when working with an open source project (unless we&amp;rsquo;re paid full-time by the project itself). Any participating organization has their own mission, strategy, and interests. Some of these may be aligned with a community, and some may be aligned with a funding opportunity. It&amp;rsquo;s important to declare how these interests align and where they differ, especially as it pertains to power dynamics and how funding is used.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Carry out project planning and execution in public&lt;/strong>. Dedicated staff have more time than normal to decide and act quickly. If they don&amp;rsquo;t leave a paper trail for their work, it becomes difficult for those with less time to remain engaged and follow along. Make sure that you make your intentions, and the results of your actions, easily discoverable by those who do not have the same amount of time as you do to engage.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="accountability-allow-others-to-decide-if-youve-done-a-good-job">
Accountability: allow others to decide if you&amp;rsquo;ve done a good job
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#accountability-allow-others-to-decide-if-youve-done-a-good-job">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Accountability is a complement to transparency - you need to show others what you&amp;rsquo;re up to, and let them tell you if you&amp;rsquo;re doing a good job. At a minimum this should happen at the level of the specific funding opportunity, but ideally you should give key community members visibility and agency into your organization&amp;rsquo;s broader strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Ask for feedback about your strategic plan and how this funding fits into it&lt;/strong>. Tell a community about what you&amp;rsquo;re up to, and why you think this funding is in both of your interests to receive. Let them know how it fits in with the big picture.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Give strategic oversight to community members that work for a different stakeholder&lt;/strong>. Give special attention to at least one community member that does not work for the same organization (for example, by creating an advisory board and briefing them on your progress and planning). This will help a more neutral perspective represent the interests of the community and avoid potential conflicts of interest.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Perform an audit of your work and share it with others&lt;/strong>. Do your best to objectively assess your own progress towards your goals, and whether you believe you&amp;rsquo;ve represented the community&amp;rsquo;s interests in working towards them. Other community members may not have the resources to do this on their own, and you should use your dedicated funding to perform this yourself (while understandably declaring a conflict of interest in assessing your own work).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="equity-share-resources-and-knowledge-with-others">
Equity: share resources and knowledge with others
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#equity-share-resources-and-knowledge-with-others">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Open communities are a vehicle for building collaborations that span countries, economic situations, and use-cases. They are powerful because of their diverse and multi-stakeholder nature. However, they also exist in a society that is deeply inequitable and that perpetuates centers of wealth and power. This means that most open communities will have a subset of stakeholders with connections and resources that are unavailable to others. To ensure that we follow the principles of open culture, it is crucial that we find ways to push against this inequitable system by sharing resources with one another wherever possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, getting funding often means &lt;em>centralizing the ability to act in a small subset of people&lt;/em>. This runs the risk that decision-making (see above) and organizational knowledge become centralized with those individuals. If you&amp;rsquo;re paid full-time to work on an open source project, there&amp;rsquo;s a good chance you will personally come to understand the codebase better than anybody else just because you have the time to learn it. This can turn into an anti-pattern where those with access to resources have an unfair power advantage in their perspective over the project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, running open source projects requires work on &lt;em>both&lt;/em> the creating and the receiving end. You can pay somebody to write a bunch of code, but somebody else still has to review it, lead discussions, and ultimately decide to merge.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Share funding with others.&lt;/strong> If your work is going to require reviews and input from others, find a way to compensate them for their time (if they wish). Prioritize sharing resources with orgs from historically marginalized or disadvantaged communities. When dedicated resources are available, use them for these kinds of groups.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Prioritize documentation and knowledge sharing.&lt;/strong> It can be attractive to work on shiny new things, but it is &lt;em>crucial&lt;/em> that you put in the work to share knowledge with others in a community so that your funding doesn&amp;rsquo;t become a source of knowledge and power centralization. Document your planning and work, and use that funding to make extra efforts to share your experience with others.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Define practices for making changes that require at least two stakeholders&lt;/strong>. This helps ensure that those funded to work on open source cannot overpower others in the community just because of their dedicated time. It also encourages healthier collaboration and communication between stakeholders.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="inclusion-bring-others-along-with-you">
Inclusion: bring others along with you
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#inclusion-bring-others-along-with-you">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A differentiating aspect of open communities is the way in which they &lt;em>share power among stakeholders&lt;/em>. Funding is inherently tied to power, as it gives you the ability to pay people to do things. Moreover, a stakeholder that &lt;em>controls&lt;/em> funding also controls what it is used for. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s not enough to simply share funding with others in a project, &lt;em>if that funding comes with strings attached&lt;/em>. It is also important to share opportunities for funding with others, and to build coalitions of equals when pursuing new funding.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Collaborators should be given agency over what they want to do with funding. They should be part of grant planning, project planning, etc. They should be seen as co-leads in discussion and announcements. Obviously any funding opportunity will come with obligations, but the important thing is who gets to decide what the team commits to in the first place, and how they plan to accomplish their goals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are a few tips to follow:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Invite others to participate in funding opportunities, especially if they need it&lt;/strong>. If you identify a funding opportunity, tell others about it. Invite them to collaborate with you on a proposal, or encourage them to write their own proposal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Treat other stakeholders as partners, not contractors&lt;/strong>. Treat collaborators as co-equals that have a say in leadership, strategy, and planning. Funding shouldn&amp;rsquo;t solely come in the form of &amp;ldquo;strings attached&amp;rdquo; and contract work. It should center others as collaborators and leads that bring their own ideas to the table.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Find ways to give power to those who historically do not have it&lt;/strong>. Consider the power dynamics of who applies for funding and actively invite participation from those that need it or that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have access to these resources on their own. If you have a personal connection, use it to bring others to the table. If you&amp;rsquo;re at a well-known organization, use it to boost the profile of others.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

How do I actually implement any of this?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-do-i-actually-implement-any-of-this">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The ideas in this post are principles and goals to strive for. They also touch on very complex subjects, and following them all perfectly is unrealistic given the state of most organizations. The point is not to define a specific roadmap of actions that must be followed, but to note a few major anti-patterns and ways to avoid them. Fundamentally, your goal should be to &lt;strong>build trust with a community&lt;/strong> and to &lt;strong>live up to the community&amp;rsquo;s mission and values&lt;/strong>. Do what you can, and be honest and open with others in your efforts. A little bit of transparency and effort goes a long way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As for 2i2c, we hope to use the ideas in this post to define a strategy and set of policies for how to engage with directed funding for open source. We&amp;rsquo;ll share new ideas in the coming weeks.&lt;/p>
