&lt;a href="https://hub.jupyter.org/binder-data/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org usage dashboards&lt;/a> and provides a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binder-data" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >daily-published dataset&lt;/a> that researchers and communities use to understand how Binder is being used across different domains and scientific communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While updating our
&lt;a href="" >quarterly Binder impact report&lt;/a>, we discovered the archive index page had stopped updating. The analytics publisher was writing index files to temporary storage before uploading to Google Cloud Storage, but for some reason the upload step stopped working. We
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/3462" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >deployed a fix&lt;/a> that eliminates the temporary files entirely - the code now generates the HTML index as a string in memory and uploads directly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Fortunately, we didn&amp;rsquo;t lose any data! Thanks to some smart design decisions, the daily analytics files were being collected properly the entire time, only the index page listing them was broken. You can find

To this end, 2i2c in close collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a> have developed the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-home-nfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/code> project&lt;/a> which is a Helm chart that permits enforcing per-user quotas on the storage space.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-note">
&lt;div>
Note that this feature is currently available to AWS hosted hubs only and will be rolled out to other cloud providers in the future.
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Under the hood, the Helm chart runs
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NFS Ganesha&lt;/a> as an in-cluster NFS server, backed by
&lt;a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-xfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >XFS&lt;/a> as the underlying filesystem. Storage quota is enforced through XFS&amp;rsquo;s native quota management utility &lt;code>xfs_quota&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this feature moves our infrastructure away from managed filesystems (such as AWS&amp;rsquo;s Elastic File System) that cannot support per-user storage quotas, we have also developed monitoring and alerting mechanisms that will let us know when the disks are getting full, and automated back-ups for disaster recovery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to try this on your 2i2c-managed hub,
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/support" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >please get in touch&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project can also be used with &lt;em>any&lt;/em> Kubernetes-based JupyterHub, as per our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Right to Replicate policy&lt;/a>, so please try it out on your own deployment and let us know what you think!&lt;/p>
