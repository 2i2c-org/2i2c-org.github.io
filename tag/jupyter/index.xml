JupyterHub: A multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-a-multi-user-server-for-jupyter-notebooks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is how JupyterHub was described when it was announced in 2015, 10 years ago. The focus was on bringing Jupyter Notebooks to multiple users on shared infrastructure. The Jupyter Notebooks focus was so strong that Jupyter was even in the name of the project! Fast forward 10 years, &amp;amp; this is still the most common perception of JupyterHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this has not been true for a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> time now. Instead of setting up 5 different kinds of infrastructure to support your users based on what kind of &lt;em>interface&lt;/em> they like to use (
&lt;a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterLab&lt;/a>,

&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Visual Studio Code&lt;/a>, full &lt;code>ssh&lt;/code> (!?), etc) for their interactive computing, you can set up a JupyterHub that supports all of those! Meet your users where they are, rather than force them to conform to using only a specific set of tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Come to this talk to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>See cool demos of various popular applications running on JupyterHub seamlessly&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the security model of JupyterHub &amp;amp; how that enables these cool demos&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn how you can set up your own application to run in JupyterHub&lt;/li>

&lt;h2 id="cloudy-with-a-chance-of-savings-per-user-usage-and-cost-monitoring-for-jupyterhubs-in-the-cloud">
Cloudy with a Chance of Savings: Per-User Usage and Cost Monitoring for JupyterHubs in the Cloud
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cloudy-with-a-chance-of-savings-per-user-usage-and-cost-monitoring-for-jupyterhubs-in-the-cloud">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cloud cost monitoring is moving beyond just preventing runaway cost explosions – it&amp;rsquo;s about empowering JupyterHub administrators with the guardrails they need to run efficient, transparent, and sustainable infrastructures. A cloud cost bill can show a broad view of services and machines provisioned, but how can we provide granular insights into each user and the value they are deriving from the hub on an application level?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve developed several open-source components towards answering this question:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Metric Collection&lt;/strong> –
&lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Prometheus&lt;/a> collects resource usage metrics (including CPU, memory, and storage) from individual user pods via standard and custom exporters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cost Estimation&lt;/strong> – Usage is correlated with AWS cost data to estimate per-user costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Visualization&lt;/strong> –
&lt;a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Grafana&lt;/a> dashboards display rich, interactive views of usage and cost data, making it easy to monitor trends, identify high-cost workloads, and generate reports for funders and decision-makers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This approach delivers cloud observability and cost transparency that can be reliably deployed using
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kubernetes&lt;/a> and integrated with
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Zero to JupyterHub&lt;/a> distributions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="controlling-home-directory-costs-with-user-empathy-on-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-home-nfs">
Controlling home directory costs (with user empathy) on the cloud with jupyterhub-home-nfs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#controlling-home-directory-costs-with-user-empathy-on-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-home-nfs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>User home directories on JupyterHubs deployed in cloud providers has been a pain point for both end users and administrators. Administrators feel the pain of cloud costs for home directory storage (sometimes higher than compute!). No user wants to receive an email saying &amp;ldquo;well, this code you copy pasted downloaded 3TB of netcdf files into your home directory, and now we have used up our entire team&amp;rsquo;s cloud budget for the next 2 years&amp;rdquo; (true story).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-home-nfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/a> open source project is a JupyterHub native, cloud agnostic solution to these problems. Administrators can do per user limits, tune performance, report on usage and make cloud cost conscious choices around overprovisioning. It provides users empathetic guardrails to prevent them from overuse, rather than punitive gates that zap them after the fact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this short talk, we will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Describe the core of the problem, and how it manifests for users and admins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Review current solutions and their limitations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce jupyterhub-home-nfs and how it moves the solution space forward&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Demo how this looks like for an end user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk about future direction, and opportunities for collaboration&lt;/li>

&lt;p>Have you stopped using mybinder.org for your tutorials, repositories and presentations because you could no longer rely on it to work each time?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>mybinder.org is open infrastructure run by incredible volunteers (who go above and beyond constantly) in the Jupyter community. Is &amp;lsquo;slow fade into unreliability&amp;rsquo; just the fate of all openly run infrastructure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But perhaps maybe, just maybe, you have tried doing that again recently, &amp;amp; noticed improvements! Launches are more reliable. Faster. The UI looks better. Maybe things are getting better?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk will go through the problems facing mybinder.org &amp;amp; what we are doing about it. Come to this talk to find out:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>How is mybinder.org run?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What are the structural issues facing open infrastructure services like mybinder.org?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What sustainability experiments are we running to improve reliability and rebuild user trust?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Has reliability actually improved?&lt;/li>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Your JupyterHub is all set up, and you&amp;rsquo;re excited to use it for your workshop of 60 students. Or your class of 600 students. Or your research group of 5 people with complex workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You &lt;em>feel&lt;/em> your infrastructure should hold up fine, but do you &lt;em>know&lt;/em> if your infrastructure will hold up fine? Is that just excitement, or is there a little bit of nervousness in there too? Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it be nice to test and know for sure?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>jupyterhub-simulator&lt;/code> is an open source project that allows you to describe what you expect your users to be doing - starting servers, clicking on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> links, running notebooks, etc. Once you have described it, you can then simulate any number of users doing that workflow simultaneously, and verify that your JupyterHub can handle that workload. If it can&amp;rsquo;t, tweak your infrastructure and try again until it does!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this talk you will learn:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>What is &lt;code>jupyterhub-simulator&lt;/code>?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can I describe my expected workflow?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can I test if N users can do this workflow all simultaneously?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can I visualize the performance of my infrastructure so I can tweak its configuration and try the simulation again?&lt;/li>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Open source communities can be incredible and irreplaceable sources of human connection in our lives, offering a unique kind of fulfillment hard to find elsewhere. This feeling of fulfillment and approval can, for some people, be a soothing balm in an otherwise rough life. However, it has the be part of a healthy, balanced ecosystem of different kinds of connections offering different kinds of fulfillment . If a significant chunk of fulfillment in your life comes from the open source work you do, unbalanced by other sources, that can quickly become unhealthy for both you and the community. Disagreements are more likely to become high stakes. Interactions can quickly become emotionally charged and filled with hard to interpret subtext. This can both burn you out, and drive away potential new community members.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk explores the why &lt;em>emotional regulation&lt;/em> is a critical skill for participating in open source communities, and how therapy can be a tool for learning that skill. Come to learn:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>What is &lt;em>emotional regulation&lt;/em>?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Why should I care?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What is therapy and how can I access it?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Wait that&amp;rsquo;s not what I thought therapy was! Are you telling me Missy Armitage lied in &lt;em>Get Out&lt;/em>?!&lt;/li>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-2i2c-has-learned-while-trying-to-build-sustainable-relationships-with-jupyters-community">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a non-profit organization that fosters co-creation and collaboration between science communities and open source communities. We are deeply embedded in an international network of research and education communities, as well as open source communities that underlie their infrastructure (particularly in the Jupyter ecosystem). Our technical infrastructure is built entirely with open source components that we contribute to, but do not control. This is a really hard problem to solve!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot in the first four years of our existence. This talk will describe how our organization approaches a healthy and productive open source relationship with the Jupyter (and broader scientific python) ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;ll cover some of the major mistakes we&amp;rsquo;ve made, lessons learned, and where we think we&amp;rsquo;ve had impact. We aim to make this talk full of practical learnings that others can follow in building sustainable open science organizations that contribute to a healthy and vibrant open source ecosystem. Our goal will be to provide inspiration to others that are interested in building on top of open source projects like Jupyter, and want to do so in a way that is healthy and sustainable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Chris is joining Project Jupyter's Executive Council</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/jupyter-executive-council/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Mar 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/jupyter-executive-council/</guid><description>&lt;p>We are proud to announce that 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s Executive Director, Chris Holdgraf, was
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/project-jupyters-2025-executive-council-elections-605b183ec64c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >recently elected to Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s Executive Council&lt;/a>. The 2i2c team discussed whether Chris should run for this position last year, and concluded that it was a way for our non-profit to both support Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s mission at a strategic level, and represent the interests of research and education communities in Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s direction. Chris wrote
&lt;a href="https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2025/jupyter-org-structure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a blog post about his reasons for running&lt;/a> with more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of Chris&amp;rsquo; goals is to be a transparent source of information about what the council is working on, where its priorities lie, and what are the major challenges it is trying to tackle. He&amp;rsquo;s written two blog posts that describe some of his experiences so far, at the links below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2025/os-support" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >On the ways that the Jupyter Foundation could support the Jupyter Project with its funds&lt;/a>&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re hopeful that this is a way for 2i2c to scale its impact and lean into its
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/open-technology/" >commitment to open technology&lt;/a>. Chris intends to keep writing about his personal experience via
&lt;a href="https://chrisholdgraf.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >his blog&lt;/a>, and we&amp;rsquo;ll provide updates here for major developments that are relevant to 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s network of communities.
We&amp;rsquo;re proud to have Chris in this role, and excited for his contributions to the Jupyter community!&lt;/p>
