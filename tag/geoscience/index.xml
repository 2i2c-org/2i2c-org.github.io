&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia&lt;/a> provides educational resources for essential software tools that enable open, reproducible and scalable geoscience, such as the
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a> stack of packages (Xarray, Dask, Jupyter). Their &lt;em>Cookbooks&lt;/em> are crowdsourced, community-curated, and open-source collections of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate how to use these tools for cloud-native, geoscientific workflows (see our
&lt;a href="" >Project Pythia Cookoff&lt;/a> blog post). However, &amp;ldquo;Jupyter notebook obsolescence&amp;rdquo; is a common problem: tutorials that were created a few years ago may no longer work due to changes in the software ecosystem and hampers the reproducibility of scientific results. A reproducible execution environment and the infrastructure to support it are essential for the long-term sustainability of these educational resources.&lt;/p>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#leveraging-nsf-funded-cyberinfrastructure-for-binderhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a> allows users to dynamically create custom computing environments from
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html#what-is-a-binder" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder-ready&lt;/a> repositories containing computational notebooks and configuration files that describe the software environment required to run them. A public Binder service exists at
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> (see our blog post about
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/binder-singlenode/" >joining the mybinder federation&lt;/a> 🎉) and is a successful example of how open cloud infrastructure can accommodate reproducible execution environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The resources available on such a public service are limited therefore 2i2c, together with Project Pythia, have been exploring how to deploy a BinderHub backed by larger resources from the NSF-funded cloud computing platform
&lt;a href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jetstream2&lt;/a>. This allows for larger simultaneous user loads, such as at workshops, as well as access to more powerful distributed and parallelized workflows required to process large geoscientific datasets, under a persistent resource allocation.&lt;/p>

Learning how to deploy on OpenStack
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#learning-how-to-deploy-on-openstack">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Jetstream2 uses
&lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OpenStack&lt;/a> in order to manage pools of compute, storage and networking resources, and for our purposes we specifically make use of OpenStack
&lt;a href="https://docs.openstack.org/magnum/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Magnum&lt;/a>
&lt;a href="https://specs.openstack.org/openstack//magnum-specs/specs/bobcat/clusterapi-driver.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Cluster API driver&lt;/a> to manage Kubernetes for our deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Cluster API needs a &lt;code>CAPI management cluster&lt;/code> in order to manage other Kubernetes clusters, called workload clusters. On Jetstream2, this management cluster is gracefully created and operated by the Jetstream2 team, which means that the only task to worry about is creating and configuring the workload cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the workload cluster we used the
&lt;a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/terraform-provider-openstack/openstack/latest/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Openstack Terraform provider&lt;/a> to define the cluster template, the cluster itself and the node groups in a reproducible way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the cluster infrastructure was successfully created on Jetstream2, thanks to the 2i2c hub infrastructure being cloud agnostic as well, deploying BinderHub to Jetstream2, was a seamless experience and it was no different than on other cloud providers that we already supported.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also learnt about some limitations of the Openstack Magnum driver project, which were expected given it being a relatively recent project, slowly being adopted, but they were all reported upstream and hopefully will soon be fixed.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Project Pythia is an open access educational initiative established with funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Its mission is to help students and scientists enhance their skills and adopt best practices using the tools and technologies of open science. As part of the Pangeo community, Project Pythia primarily focuses on the Pangeo stack, which includes cloud computing, Jupyter technologies, GitHub, and various software packages in the Scientific Python ecosystem, centered around Xarray. Project Pythia offers a wide range of open access content, such as datasets, software, tutorials, and annotated real-world workflows presented in the form of Jupyter Books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project Pythia serves as a resource for scientists, promoting and fostering open science. Although it is not a scientific research artifact itself, the development of Project Pythia adheres to many best practices advocated by open science proponents. The Pythia team actively encourages community engagement and collaborates openly with scientists and technologists to create new content. All Pythia resources are freely accessible, and the project follows the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) for managing research outputs, including publications, data, and other materials. We support and facilitate open evaluation and peer reviews of content to ensure verifiability and trust. Lastly, we endeavor to openly discuss ideas, designs, and methods before implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation will provide an overview of Project Pythia&amp;rsquo;s extensive educational resources and share our experiences in applying many open science principles to develop this flagship training resource for the geoscience community.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-1">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, while bringing NASA&amp;rsquo;s Earth System Observatory &lt;em>up to speed&lt;/em> with aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial science capabilities, is also providing data records of the Earth System for the next generation of scientists &lt;em>to grow into&lt;/em>. The goal of the PACE Hackweek, supported by the Ocean Carbon &amp;amp; Biogeochemistry program and hosted at the University of Maryland Baltimore County in August 2024, was to enrich and support the practice of open science by both emerging and established researchers. Cloud-compute resources for the event were provided by CryoCloud, a NASA funded collaboration between ICESat-2 and the International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c) to provide cryosphere researchers with a shared JupyterHub. We, the hackweek mentors, were buoyed by the NASA Openscapes program and adopted its mantra of striving toward &amp;ldquo;a kinder science for future us.&amp;rdquo; Participants faced two novelties: the &amp;ldquo;firehose&amp;rdquo; of data from the PACE instrument array (a hyper-spectral imaging spectrometer, a wide-swath hyper-angular polarimeter, and a narrow-swath spectro-polarimeter), and the distribution of PACE collections through the NASA Earthdata Cloud (a first for the Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center). We present our approach and the challenges undertaken to hold an in-person, social coding event with 45 participants that provided a collaborative, supportive launchpad for doing open science with PACE. All lectures and tutorials produced for the event are freely available for examination and reuse. Our results additionally include highlights from the demonstration projects pursued by event participants and results from two post-event, qualitative surveys. One anonymous survey gathered participant feedback that will inform plans for growing these 45 participants into a lasting, open community. A separate, anonymous survey recorded participant demographics in order to evaluate our efforts at increasing diversity within the community of PACE data users. Key points of discussion include participant views, informed by our event, on whether and how the NASA Earthdata Cloud is a significant resource for the practice of open science with PACE, and how a shared JupyterHub can further the practice of open science by the community it serves.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>If we&amp;rsquo;re asking people to change for open science, we must be willing to change ourselves. Internalizing this as individuals and institutions is critical - &amp;ldquo;to address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver&amp;rdquo; (Johnson &amp;amp; Wilkinson, All We Can Save).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radically reshaping our society and including more solvers requires Earth scientists of all disciplines, across AGU, to work together in new ways. Many of these shifts can be considered Open science. They change how we work daily, not just the open products we produce. And for that, people need to consider themselves part of a team, let go of perfection and embrace a growth mindset to continually reflect and improve skills – no matter their job title. Further, open science requires all of us to see ourselves as leaders making small changes that collectively add up to a movement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Openscapes is an open source approach to cultivating leaders and change makers. Openscapes&amp;rsquo; flywheel approach intervenes and builds momentum through identifying mentors within organizations and mentoring teams curious about shifting to open science (Robinson &amp;amp; Lowndes 2022). Collectively, the Openscapes flywheel iterations have had a significant impact over the past five years across institutions like the federal government and academia that seem impossible to change. Through stories working with professional scientists over the past 5 years including at NASA, NOAA, Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science, and many universities, and open source software communities like 2i2c, Posit, Pangeo, and RLadies, we will share actionable insights for flourishing in the open science commons, and are interested in learning with and growing flywheel momentum further at AGU.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-3">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The Earth Observation (EO) industry has seen rapid technological advancements alongside a massive increase in the number of private and public missions, leading to exponentially growing data archives. For publicly funded entities, this data is typically required to be freely available. However, open data does not always guarantee accessibility, and significant barriers remain for even the most advanced users. The stagnation in the use and adoption of open data can be attributed to several factors, including 1) challenges in unifying and maintaining metadata standards, 2) inefficiencies associated with legacy data formats, 3) a lack of training and resources for transitioning to cloud-based infrastructure, and 4) systemic social inequalities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk will explore real-life examples of these barriers and highlight success stories that have emerged from partnerships largely originating within open-source communities which foster diverse connections between private and public entities including efforts like GeoZarr, pangeo-forge, Openscapes and 2i2c. While many advancements in improving the usability and accessibility of EO data have come from private efforts (i.e. Google Earth Engine), the shutdown of the Planetary Computer is a reminder of the need for publicly funded alternatives. The sustainability of open source projects will be addressed, with questions posed around reliable funding mechanisms as a means to ensure equitable development to address barriers and ensure accessibility for all. While this talk will be presented by one individual, it is the review and reflection of the work done by dozens of people across various organizations.&lt;/p>

Abstract

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The EarthScope Consortium manages NSF&amp;rsquo;s GAGE and SAGE facilities and makes all of its geophysical data available in a commercial cloud system. This enables EarthScope and the communities it supports to leverage the abundant computational resources and cost-effective benefits of adopting data-proximate workflows with direct access to large, analysis-ready geophysical data sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In recent years, JupyterHub environments have gained popularity with data enthusiasts for their ability to provide open access to powerful compute resources. As part of a broad effort to support communities with intuitive resources to quickly adapt their workflows to the cloud, EarthScope has partnered with 2i2c to operate a scalable JupyterHub environment in AWS that will provide equitable access to cloud compute resources for researchers, educators, and the general public. GeoLab, the EarthScope hub, is aligned with related open science initiatives to establish rigorous and transparent standards for reproducible, data-intensive workflows. In addition to promoting interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborative work between researchers in GeoLab, EarthScope is developing and hosting workshops that can support both in-person and asynchronous learning modules that will train users how to utilize these new resources and transition their work to the cloud. We are excited to invite all geophysical data users to participate in the vigorous growth of this new platform and collaborate with adjacent open-science compute hub initiatives.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-5">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Project Pythia is the flagship education and training initiative of the Pangeo community. Pangeo has advanced transformative platforms and paradigms for &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; geoscience in the cloud; Pythia is creating on-ramps for new users with open, interactive learning resources centered on Python in the geosciences. Pythia is now building a vibrant community-owned clearinghouse of accessible, reusable, and reproducible tutorials and exemplar workflows in the cloud known as Pythia Cookbooks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Cookbooks&amp;rdquo; imply collections of recipes for transforming raw ingredients (publicly available data) into scientifically useful results. Based on Jupyter notebooks, Cookbooks are explicitly tied to reproducible computational environments and supported by a rich cloud-based infrastructure enabling collaborative authoring and automated health-checking – essential tools in the struggle against the widespread notebook obsolescence problem. Cookbooks are hosted on Pythia&amp;rsquo;s searchable gallery and nurtured by a growing community of open science enthusiasts from across the geosciences. The Pythia Cookbook gallery is essentially a crowd-sourced, community-curated collection of best practices for data analysis and visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we will outline the stack of technologies and infrastructure enabling cookbook creation, collaboration, testing, publication, and interactive deployment, and how these are used in service of building an inclusive participatory community. We will discuss existing technical and social hurdles for contributors, as well as new infrastructure developments in collaboration with the Executable Books Project that are reducing these hurdles.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-6">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In this talk we will highlight our NASA Openscapes community teaching approach to using the 2i2c-managed JupyterHub – how we&amp;rsquo;ve collaboratively developed it to meet user needs, and how it continues to enable researchers and users of NASA Earthdata in the new Cloud paradigm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NASA Openscapes is an open source mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers (
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >DAACs&lt;/a>) that helps users explore and use the Cloud for their science and applications.
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Earthdata Cloud Cookbook&lt;/a> is a learner-focused open source tutorial collection that we update openly as we learn together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A critical piece of the NASA Openscapes effort is our &lt;strong>NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub&lt;/strong>, a managed cloud computing space. By working with cloud early adopters and science
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2024-07-24-2024-nasa-champions-cohort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Champions&lt;/a>, responding and co-developing solutions, the JupyterHub has evolved since its early days in 2021. We support cloud computing for several languages (python, R, Matlab, QGIS) and common science libraries with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/corn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >corn&lt;/a>; we streamlined how to bulk-add workshop participants via GitHub Teams; we established policy and technology for a special authentication mechanism for large scale workshops; we are developing earthaccess as an community-developed python library for NASA Earthdata search and access, whether locally or in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the last 3 years of engaging with the user community and the Hub, we have &lt;strong>evolved&lt;/strong> how we &lt;strong>onboard&lt;/strong> (first experience in the cloud) and &lt;strong>fledge&lt;/strong> (set up for Cloud that includes a plan, how to do it, how to pay for it; leaving the nest and perhaps building your own). Fledging is an important part of adoption and initiating users to the Cloud - where do researchers go when they decide to do their science in the Cloud? We&amp;rsquo;ve been developing practices that aim to be equitable and consider policy (cost), technical (where do people go, what admin setup is needed, what tech like base images etc are needed), and social (how do I learn, get support) aspects, and look forward to discussing further at AGU.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-7">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Numerical models are essential for forecasting volcanic hazards for both short-term responses and long-term hazard assessment. While many models of volcanic processes already exist, challenges in finding, installing, and evaluating these models, coupled with limited computational resources, hinder their widespread use. To address this, we introduce VICTOR, the Volcanology Infrastructure for Computational Tools and Resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR is a cutting-edge cyber-infrastructure platform offering an open-source, cloud-based environment tailored for the volcanology community. It features Jupyter notebooks that integrate existing volcano models, such as the lava flow codes MOLASSES and IMEX_lava, the tephra and ash dispersal codes Tephra2 and HYSPLIT, and the mass flow code TITAN2D. The backend of VICTOR is managed as a JupyterHub, operated by the non-profit 2i2c under the Code for Science and Society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR not only provides access to individual modeling tools, but also hosts workflows that use them in data inversion, model benchmarking, and uncertainty quantification. For example, we developed a workflow to validate mass flow models using multiple metrics and Bayesian statistics. VICTOR provides built-in access to external databases such as OpenTopography, Copernicus, and NASA&amp;rsquo;s remote sensing products to streamline obtaining and using data in workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR also serves as an educational resource. In Spring 2023 and 2024 we taught graduate level, multi-institutional courses in Computational Volcanology using VICTOR, and we are creating multilingual tutorials for the workflows. We are developing teaching modules on topics such as lava flows and remote sensing to be shared with instructors. Lastly, VICTOR collaborates with national efforts including CONVERSE and SZ4D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, VICTOR addresses the critical need for accessible, effective volcanic hazard modeling tools and resources, fostering advancements in both research and education within the volcanology community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plain-language-summary">
Plain-language Summary
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#plain-language-summary">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>VICTOR is a new online platform designed to help scientists predict volcanic hazards more easily. Traditional models can be difficult to find, use, and combine with other tools. VICTOR solves these problems by offering a cloud-based, open-source environment with user-friendly tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR includes tools like Jupyter notebooks that combine various volcano models for lava flows, ash dispersal, and mass movements. It operates through JupyterHub, managed by the non-profit 2i2c. The platform not only provides access to these models but also offers workflows for tasks like data analysis and model validation. For example, it has a workflow for testing mass flow models using multiple evaluation methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR simplifies data access by connecting directly to databases like OpenTopography and NASA&amp;rsquo;s remote sensing products. It&amp;rsquo;s also an educational tool, used in graduate courses and offering multilingual tutorials. Additionally, VICTOR is developing teaching materials on topics like lava flows and remote sensing and collaborates with national projects like CONVERSE and SZ4D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In essence, VICTOR makes volcanic hazard modeling more accessible and effective, benefiting both research and education in volcanology.&lt;/p>

Machine Learning with GPUs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#machine-learning-with-gpus">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the most advanced tutorials delivered during the hackathon was the
&lt;a href="https://pacehackweek.github.io/pace-2024/presentations/hackweek/ml_cloud_mask.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Machine Learning Tutorial&lt;/a>. The tutorial focused on creating a machine learning pipeline to detect cloud cover from satellite imagery. This was done by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to assign each pixel a binary value to indicate whether the location was covered by cloud or not. To improve the spatial context beyond a single pixel value, as the likelihood of a pixel containing cloud cover increases if its neighbours also contain cloud cover, the CNN needs to be trained on the entire image at once rather than at a single pixel level. This massively increases the training time, but also allows the CNN to learn more complex relationships between pixels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GPUs have a far greater number of cores than CPUs that are well-suited for accelerating the massive parallel processing needed to train a neural network on the large amounts of image data in the above scenario.
&lt;a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PyTorch&lt;/a> is a popular Python library for training CNNs, available for both CPUs and GPUs, and is an ideal tool for performing this kind of work. In terms of the accelerator hardware available on the CryoCloud hub, 2i2c provisions an instance with an
&lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU&lt;/a> with 4 CPUS, 16GB of RAM and 2,560 CUDA cores.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managing-shared-memory-on-2i2c-hubs">
Managing shared memory on 2i2c hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managing-shared-memory-on-2i2c-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While developing the above tutorial, tutorial lead Sean Foley (NASA/GSFC/SED &amp;amp; Morgan State University &amp;amp; GESTAR II) noticed that training neural networks was way slower than it should be given the GPUs available to them. They investigated the issue, and with help from the 2i2c engineering team, it was determined that shared memory was the issue. PyTorch uses shared memory via &lt;code>/dev/shm&lt;/code> for faster parallel processing, and maximizing use of GPU. However in containerized environments, this is limited to a maximum of 64MB by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-note">
&lt;div>
&lt;p>You can check the amount of shared memory available on your hub in a terminal with the command&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>df -h | grep /dev/shm&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As you might expect, 64 MB of shared memory is not enough for training over 160,000 images in the tutorial. 2i2c was able to remove the limit, making &lt;code>/dev/shm&lt;/code> share the memory the user has selected via their profile list, rather than be artificially limited to any particular size. This was done for &lt;em>all&lt;/em> users on the CryoCloud hub within an hour of the issue being reported and we upstreamed the change for &lt;em>all&lt;/em> 2i2c hubs (see GitHub pull requests for
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/4564" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/4563" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >all 2i2c hubs&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This event demonstrates the economy of how running shared and open infrastructure dynamically solves problems for the benefit of many users, not just for one occasion. Learning experiences such as the above are transferred and embedded upstream into transparent and flexible open source software that impacts not only all users of 2i2c operated hubs, but also generalized for the wider research community at large (case in point, see the Slack thread below from
&lt;a href="https://eeholmes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Eli Holmes&lt;/a>, operator of the
&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-data/open-science-noaa-fisheries" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NOAA Fisheries&lt;/a> hubs)! We are grateful for the strong partnerships with our communities who help us to co-design impactful solutions that are specific for their needs and accessible to all.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://www.amerigeo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >AmeriGEO&lt;/a> provides a framework for cooperation in the Americas for the use of Earth data to benefit science and society with data driven decision-making. As part of a virtual workshop held on 1st August 2024, 2i2c provided an interactive computing environment to support the delivery of a
&lt;a href="https://www.nasa.gov/centers-and-facilities/marshall/nasa-boosts-open-science-through-innovative-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA TOPST&lt;/a> water module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The workshop was facilitated by

&lt;a href="https://ciesin.climate.columbia.edu/directory/juan-f-martinez" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Juan F. Martinez&lt;/a> (both of
&lt;a href="http://www.ciesin.columbia.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CIESIN&lt;/a>, Columbia University, New York). Juan presented interactive R code, with explanatory content written in Quarto, for hotspot vulnerability analysis for floods and landslides focused on Ecuador using earth observation data and socioeconomic data to develop an index of vulnerability.

&lt;p>The 2i2c team are proud to continue our strong working collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a>, following our previous work on launching the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/" >US GHG center&lt;/a> (also see the
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/blog/2023-12-14-ghg-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed blog post&lt;/a>). Together with scientists at NASA in our regular sync touchpoints, we have recently delivered a tranche of improvements to
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This platform is designed to thread open-source components together to consolidate GIS delivery mechanisms, processing, analysis and visualization tools, and presented in a collaborative interactive computing environment. All code repositories and associated resources stemming from this work are available on the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/VEDA/wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >VEDA GitHub page&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the spirit of fully open development, you can

the combined 2i2c and Development Seed team had for the last quarter. In this blog post, we will describe some of the significant ones!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-image-management-and-testing">
Better image management and testing
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#better-image-management-and-testing">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker-action&lt;/a> is a GitHub action simplifying image building and testing for use with JupyterHub, using either a &lt;code>Dockerfile&lt;/code> or various
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration files&lt;/a> (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code>, &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>, etc) supported by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>. We migrated our image building pipeline from a somewhat homegrown solution to this upstream action, making image updates and testing &lt;em>much&lt;/em> easier. In particular, we can
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pangeo-notebook-veda-image/pull/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >automatically run test notebooks&lt;/a> on every change we make to the image! This way, we can easily catch any breaking changes in library versions or other package installs without disrupting users. We also debugged and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action/pull/124" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >contributed upstream&lt;/a> fixes to the testing infrastructure so everyone could benefit from this, rather than just us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">
Automatically pulling example notebooks on startup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When a user logs into a JupyterHub, it is very helpful if we could have a bunch of example notebooks and other content pre-populated for them so they can get started right away.
&lt;a href="https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> is heavily used for this particular use case. However, it requires that nbgitpuller is installed inside the image the user is using - and not all images have it installed. In particular, we wanted to continue using the (wonderful)
&lt;a href="https://rocker-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Rocker images&lt;/a> maintained upstream for R users, however they do not have nbgitpuller installed. To solve this problem we built
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/jupyterhub-gitpuller-init" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-gitpuller-init&lt;/a>, which can be used as an
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >init container&lt;/a> to pre-populate user content on persistent home directories regardless of the image used. We also made sure to build this in a way that &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> can use it, and it is not tied into either 2i2c or VEDA infrastructure!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="opening-specific-visualizations-in-qgis-via-url">
Opening specific visualizations in QGIS via URL
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#opening-specific-visualizations-in-qgis-via-url">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.qgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGIS&lt;/a> is the world&amp;rsquo;s most used open source GIS software, and previously 2i2c had
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/desktop-gis-software-in-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-ddced297019a" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >worked with Openscapes and QGreenland&lt;/a> to bring this &lt;em>desktop&lt;/em> software to JupyterHub. We had previously worked on a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/nasa-qgis-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >container image&lt;/a> that allows users to access large datasets stored in the cloud directly through QGIS on the JupyterHub, allowing users to work with much larger datasets than they could on their desktops by bringing cloud compute adjacent to the data. As a continuation of this work, we developed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunu/jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy&lt;/a>, which builds QGIS specific features on top of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy&lt;/a>. In particular, it allows creation of shareable links that when clicked, opens specific datasets and layers in QGIS in a JupyterHub! You can see this in action:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This opens up exciting future possibilities. Imagine this
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/data-catalog/campfire_ndvi_difference_2015_2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >exploration of the Camp Fire&lt;/a> having an &amp;lsquo;Open in QGIS&amp;rsquo; button that enables further exploration of the data without the user needing to download or install anything! Work will continue in the coming quarter towards achieving this vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are also excited to see recent work in this space
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/jupytergis-d63b7adf9d0c" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >from QuantStack and Simula Labs&lt;/a>, and will follow up to ensure an orderly transition to more web native workflows for existing users of QGIS in due time.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is a continuation of our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" >GESIS collaboration&lt;/a>. In the path to deploying dynamic image building to end users, we wanted to stabilize
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/a> enough to deploy to users of VEDA (and eventually everyone else). This is the primary interface users see &lt;em>after&lt;/em> they log in to JupyterHub, and was ripe for UX improvements. The default interface looks like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Working closely with the 2i2c team on growing features to support users on the VEDA and GHG Center hubs has been absolutely amazing. With 2i2c’s deep experience in the Jupyter ecosystem, we have been able to implement some fairly complex features quite easily, and their strong open-source roots have ensured that whatever we work on is broadly useful to the wider Jupyter and scientific computing communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This event was attended by around 250 participants. An event of this size therefore requires a &lt;em>frictionless login flow&lt;/em> so that organizers could focus on the essential complexity of teaching data analysis rather than the accidental complexity of managing Hub authorization. GitHub authentication is the default option for most 2i2c Hubs for research use cases, but for an educational event of this size this option was not fit for purpose since organizers had to&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Retrieve the GitHub usernames of each participant (assuming everyone was familiar with GitHub!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually invite GitHub users to a GitHub organization to authorize access to the Hub (invitations would expire within seven days)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repeat the above two steps last-minute for participants who showed up on the day without preparing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually remove GitHub users from the GitHub organization if they wanted to revoke access to the Hub after the event.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In response to this need, we developed a shared password feature so that workshop organizers can simply hand the share password out to learners for access to the Hub. This bypassed the manual labour of managing GitHub accounts while not adding to the learner&amp;rsquo;s high cognitive load and improving the participant&amp;rsquo;s learning experience overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the elements that enabled us to recognize and solve this issue effectively is our close partnership with the Openscapes team. We engage in regular
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2i2cAccessPolicies/issues/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >6-weekly catch-ups&lt;/a> where we can learn about user requirements and how we can develop our infrastructure to co-create optimal solutions. Together with our
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/product/deliveryflow/#defining-our-product-delivery-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Product Delivery Flow&lt;/a>, we were quickly able to architect the shared password solution in time for the workshop.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-did-we-do">
What did we do?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-did-we-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As part of the deliverables for our NASA High Priority Open-Source Science (HPOSS) award, we deployed two new ephemeral hubs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>a
&lt;a href="https://binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >public small BinderHub&lt;/a> that offers a &amp;ldquo;reader&amp;rdquo; experience where learners can interactively view GitHub repositories that deliver light scientific content with small compute and no barriers to authentication&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a
&lt;a href="https://hub.big.binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >big BinderHub&lt;/a> that offers an &amp;ldquo;explorer&amp;rdquo; experience where learners can log in to access more substantial compute resources to interactively investigate large datasets and run large workflows from any GitHub repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These services enrich the interactive computing ecosystem for NASA communities by&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>improving the shareability and reproducibility of scientific information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>broadening participation for historically excluded and under-resourced science communities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enabling activities such as hackathons, demonstrations or training, during workshops and conferences.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-did-we-do-it">
How did we do it?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-we-do-it">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ephemeral interactive computing services benefited from some of our previous development work in collaboration with GESIS (see our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" >detailed blog post&lt;/a> for more information). The research and development of this project achieved wide-reaching impact across many NASA communities we currently serve, including

&lt;h2 id="what-next">
What next?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We will focus on bolstering the community- and knowledge-building needed for making the best use of these binder services in the next phase of our HPOSS work to accelerate broader participation in science. This includes opportunities such as running workshops and tutorials, as well as disseminating best practices for collaborative research. Further engineering developments will proceed in collaboration with the NASA VEDA project to set up a binder service, improve the sharing of custom environments, and refine QGIS integrations for analysing geospatial data.&lt;/p>

Can I use this ephemeral hub service?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-use-this-ephemeral-hub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The answer is yes!&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (
&lt;a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CIRA&lt;/a>) is an interdisciplinary cooperation between NOAA research scientists and Colorado State University. CIRA is hosting a
&lt;a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/conferences/rmtgw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >summer school&lt;/a> for inverse modeling of greenhouse gases using atmospheric data assimilation techniques. The
&lt;a href="https://earth.gov/ghgcenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >US Greenhouse Gas Center&lt;/a> is supporting the workshop by providing 40+ attendees access to their interactive computing hub operated by 2i2c (see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/" >our blog post about their launch&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hub administrators have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/ssim-ghg-workshop-2024-python-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >built a customized software environment&lt;/a> with container technology for use at the workshop. In doing so, this bypasses the need for participants to individually install software on their own machines and the online hub provides a &lt;em>consistent&lt;/em> and &lt;em>reproducible&lt;/em> interactive computing environment that is easily &lt;em>accessible&lt;/em> and &lt;em>scalable&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

Scientific Context

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It was controversial in 1827 when Joseph Fourier (the discoverer of the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction#Fourier%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >law of heat conduction&lt;/a>) argued &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that the atmosphere keeps the Earth warm, like a puffy down comforter, but it&amp;rsquo;s not now. Gases in the atmosphere trap heat near Earth. How much heat is trapped depends on the gas mixture. Putting more heat-trapping gases in is like putting a wool blanket on top of the down comforter. Human activity since industrialization is injecting lots more heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere and changing the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The science is clear. The up-to-date consensus view of the global scientific community is expressed in the
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sixth Assessment Report&lt;/a> of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):&lt;/p>

A glossary of acronyms and additional background:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The First World Climate Conference (&lt;strong>WCC-1&lt;/strong>) &lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> was held in 1979.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The World Climate Programme (
&lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/programmes/world-climate-programme" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >WCP&lt;/a>), an activity overseen by the
&lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >World Meteorological Organization&lt;/a> was established after WCC-1. WCP, in partnership with other organizations, operates programs (e.g. the
&lt;a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >World Climate Research Program (WCRP)&lt;/a>) that organize and integrate international scientific efforts to understand the climate. The WMO also operates the
&lt;a href="https://ig3is.wmo.int/en/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System (IG3IS)&lt;/a>, a natural partner for the emerging work described below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WCRP manages the
&lt;a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Common Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)&lt;/a>. CMIP serves as a kind of &lt;strong>league for intercomparing models&lt;/strong> of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate system developed by teams who approach the problems with different methods and designs. Intercomparison, an approach that enables finding the consensus views of teams with divergent approaches to problems, is used in other modeling scenarios.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research papers on the climate are rapidly produced by scholars from essentially all knowledge disciplines. This overwhelming stream of content, like snowflakes in a blizzard, is coalesced into coherent and carefully scrutinized &lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >IPCC Assessment Reports&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> by the
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Earth Summit&lt;/a> held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 led to the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)&lt;/a>. The UNFCCC is an international treaty that recognizes the dangers to the climate system caused by human activity, calls for ongoing study, and establishes recurring
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Conference of the Parties (COP)&lt;/a> meetings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/event/cop-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-3 (Kyoto)&lt;/a> led to the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kyoto Protocol Treaty&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrd%E2%80%93Hagel_Resolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Byrd-Hagel Resolution&lt;/a> was a unanimous United States Senate Resolution that stipulated the United States would not sign treaties promising greenhouse gas reductions by developed countries that did not mandate similar reductions from developing countries. This killed USA participation in the Kyoto Protocol Treaty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Paris Agreement&lt;/a>, established at
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/event/cop-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-21 (Paris)&lt;/a>, effectively replaces the Kyoto Protocol, includes specifications by participant countries on greenhouse gas reductions called &lt;em>National Determined Contributions&lt;/em> (NDCs). The United States entered the Paris Agreement under President Obama, exited under President Trump and rejoined under President Biden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop26" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-26 (Glasgow)&lt;/a>established an accountability system for the Paris Agreement called the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/FAQ-moving-towards-the-ETF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)&lt;/a>. Participant countries to the Paris Agreement will
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/preparing-for-the-ETF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >submit their first Biennial Transparency Reports (BTR1) under the ETF&lt;/a> in 2024.&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually releases&lt;/a> the &lt;em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks&lt;/em> reports. These reports are submitted to the United Nations in accordance with the UNFCCC. The EPA
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/greenhouse-gas-inventory-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >openly shares&lt;/a> software, tools, data, and
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/capacity-building-national-greenhouse-gas-inventories" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >builds capacity&lt;/a> to assist other nations to assemble their own greenhouse gas inventories.&lt;/p>

The IWG, renamed as the
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/sc_co2_tsd_august_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases in 2016&lt;/a>, synthesizes research on
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >integrated assessment modelling&lt;/a> to quantify the dollar costs associated to damage caused by an incremental increase in GHG emissions in a given year. Quantifying the impacts of GHG emissions in monetary terms is vital to effective rulemaking across the Federal Government. This
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/social_cost_of_carbon_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >EPA fact sheet on the social costs of carbon&lt;/a> provides further background. A 2017 consensus report &lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> of the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) offered recommendations for ongoing research to improve the assignment of social costs to GHG emissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other federal agencies have developed expertise, data, and analyses that give insights into GHG emissions that compliment and potentially extend the &lt;em>Inventory&lt;/em> reports developed annually by the EPA. How should the United States integrate federal agency efforts to monitor and measure greenhouse gas emissions? A 2022 NASEM consensus report &lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> investigated this question. In January of this year, the
&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/01/06/biden-harris-administration-releases-new-guidance-to-disclose-climate-impacts-in-environmental-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Biden Administration&lt;/a> released guidance&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> for federal agencies on incorporating GHG emissions information in policies and reports. Shortly thereafter, a draft federal strategy to advance an integrated greenhouse gas monitoring system was
&lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bDDD1BC85-9276-8FB7-C362-A00E3E427E0D%7d&amp;amp;path=&amp;amp;method=init" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >released by NASA with a request for public input&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some important insights from the NASEM consensus report, the draft federal strategy, and the IWG reports:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Data streams on greenhouse gas emissions can be sorted into two broad categories:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Activity-based:&lt;/strong> Activity-based data, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; data, quantify GHG emissions by measuring activities that generate GHG emissions. Economic or business activity data (gallons of diesel sold in a county on Tuesday; miles flown by a 747 in October) can be converted into quantified GHG emissions information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atmospheric-based:&lt;/strong> Atmosphere-based data, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;top-down&amp;rdquo; data, quantify GHG emissions by performing atmospheric measurements. For example, the
&lt;a href="https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO2)&lt;/a> remotely senses $CO_2$ from space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A hybrid approach that blends activity-based and atmospheric-based GHG data has the potential to provide new insights.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Interoperable and easily accessed tools and data products for analyzing GHG emissions information and assigning costs should be made available across the Federal government.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GHG emissions information is needed in scenarios outside the international context of participating nations reporting for UNFCCC and Paris Agreement ETF compliance:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subnational governments&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; cities, states, provinces, counties &amp;ndash; want GHG data products to measure their progress on emission reduction programs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Facilities&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; harbours, toll roads, power plants, factories, universities &amp;ndash; similarly want GHG data products.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Companies&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; airlines, trucking, construction &amp;ndash; want GHG data products.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reliable and transparent GHG emissions information is required to enable effective environmental-social-governance (ESG) investment without “greenwashing”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accurate and improving quantifications of the social costs associated to GHG emissions require ongoing research.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>How much GHG emission is generated through oil and gas production? How much GHG emission is generated by urban centers? Do landfills contribute significant GHG emissions? How do human-generated GHG emissions compare to natural sources of GHG emissions? The U.S. GHG Center is designed to assemble the data, tools, and people to scientifically address these kinds of questions.&lt;/p>

Openness: Amplified Knowledge Sharing
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#openness-amplified-knowledge-sharing">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center builds on
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/greenhouse-gas-inventory-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >EPA&amp;rsquo;s leadership to openly share the data and tools for the &lt;em>Inventory&lt;/em>&lt;/a>and the

Instead of building a walled garden with proprietary technology from a vendor selected through RFP, the Center launched a prototype platform using curated open source tools integrated with public federal data. This &lt;strong>open toolchain approach&lt;/strong> amplifies the open data efforts developed over the past two decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. GHG Center&amp;rsquo;s interactive computing platform is &lt;strong>open source science infrastructure&lt;/strong>. The platform is:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Research, data and recommendations developed by scientists and engineers that influence policies set by democratic governments should be accessible by voters. No entity should own the ways humans communicate and learn about the Earth system. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center&amp;rsquo;s generous approach to digital infrastructure &amp;ndash; an open toolchain adjacent to open data &amp;ndash; is vital for democracy and should be replicated across government agencies worldwide.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>JupyterHub is a versatile platform that can serve a desktop with Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software in the cloud. This was demonstrated by the QGreenland Researcher Workshop that was hosted by the NASA CryoCloud hub. The hands-on workshop trained 25-30 researchers, from Germany, India, France, Canada, Poland and the United States, on how to work with geospatial data in an open science framework.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://qgreenland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGreenland&lt;/a> is an open-source geospatial data package designed for QGIS, a community-owned GIS platform. It focuses on Greenland, offering researchers and educators a comprehensive toolset for FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) data analysis. The package integrates a variety of datasets into a single, easy-to-use data-viewing and analysis platform, supporting both offline and online use. This makes it particularly valuable for remote fieldwork and areas with limited internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workshop-success">
Workshop Success
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#workshop-success">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The QGreenland workshop demonstrated several key benefits of using JupyterHub for cloud-based GIS:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Accessibility: Participants from across the world could access the same powerful GIS tools through a web browser, eliminating the need for complex local installations while enhancing reproducibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud block storage: Using a JupyterHub in the cloud allowed for faster data access than a traditional NFS file store by provisioning each user with an elastic block store disk, reducing load times from 5 minutes to under 3 seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cost Efficiency: Utilizing the CryoCloud JupyterHub instance managed by 2i2c drastically cut down setup costs and time, with only minimal cloud operating expenses of roughly $1/person/day.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The success of the QGreenland workshop underscores the potential of integrating interactive software applications in JupyterHub. This approach not only democratizes access to advanced geospatial tools but also fosters a collaborative research environment. We look forward to supporting more workshops for QGreenland in the future!&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/meetings/eddy-symposium-2022" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >3rd Eddy Cross Disciplinary Symposium&lt;/a> held recently in Vail Colorado. The event was hosted by the Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science (
&lt;a href="https://cpaess.ucar.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CPAESS&lt;/a>) team at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (
&lt;a href="https://www.ucar.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >UCAR&lt;/a>) with support from NASA.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="context">
Context
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#context">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Symposium was framed by the interesting and interdisciplinary scientific career of the late
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Eddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jack Eddy&lt;/a>. Eddy&amp;rsquo;s legacy was highlighted and his influence has been extended by dynamic leadership from NASA Program Officer
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership/lead-program-scientist-for-lws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Madhulika Guhathakurta (Lika)&lt;/a>. Lika helped launch and has sustained NASA&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/programs/living-with-a-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Living with a Star (LWS)&lt;/a> program over the past two decades. Prior to LWS, NASA had a variety of siloed efforts focused on near-Sun and near-Earth behavior. The LWS program led to an integration of these efforts under &amp;ldquo;system science&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;systems engineering&amp;rdquo; approaches and an expressed desired to connect LWS research activities with impacts on Earth (society, biology, culture, etc.). The program has expanded to include explorations of similar questions arising around other planets in our solar system and the recently discovered collection of exoplanets. Scientists from diverse disciplines (plasma physics, stellar evolution, atmospheric chemistry, space weather, planetary science,&amp;hellip;) work together on &amp;ldquo;cross disciplinary&amp;rdquo; research that helps us understand our lives near our star.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Symposium focused on three disciplinary areas (&lt;strong>Exoplanets&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Sun-Climate and Star-Climate interactions&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Risk and resilience of space weather&lt;/strong>) unified under the cross-cutting thread of &lt;strong>open science&lt;/strong>. Frequent references were made to the upcoming 2023 Year of Open Science and
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA&amp;rsquo;s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission&lt;/a>. Symposium attendees listened to talks surveying the four areas in the morning and participated in hackathon-style breakout projects during the afternoons. Work on the projects launched at the Eddy Symposium
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >continues&lt;/a>. The space weather group is investigating ways to make the power grid more resilient. The Sun-climate group is exploring plans to establish an institute focused on Sun-climate interactions and improve connections between climate and heliophysics research communities. The exoplanets team is developing tools to programmatically compare Sun-Earth and star-exoplanet interactions.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.ryanmcgranaghan.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Ryan McGranaghan&lt;/a>, rapidly deployed a cloud-hosted JupyterHub for use during the event. The hub provided a shared space for participants to explore data, run analyses, and collaborate with one another using modern tools including Zarr, Xarray and Dask Gateway. Access to the interactive computing platform was granted to any member of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Symposium&amp;rsquo;s GitHub organization&lt;/a>. The work to set up that hub, openly chronicled in this GitHub issue (

&lt;p>2i2c co-founder Fernando Pérez gave a talk on how he is

Fernando described the ways he, research collaborators, and students are using the Jupyter ecosystem. Diverse and curated tools in Jupyter hubs for the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Meets the Earth Project&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s data science programs&lt;/a> were highlighted. The talk showcased how these tools have been integrated to support individuals and communities of practice in data-driven research. In response to requests from the organizers and participants, Fernando gave a demonstration on how to use the hub 2i2c set up for the Symposium and an introduction to version control using &lt;code>git&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c co-founder Jim Colliander gave a talk titled
&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/eddy-science-commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Governing the Science Commons&lt;/a>. Three key points from Jim&amp;rsquo;s talk were: the virtue that should guide the improvements to the scientific enterprise is intellectual generosity; implementation of intellectual generosity into science requires commons-based governance; the convergence of open source tools that support data-intensive collaborative research and learning (as showcased by Fernando) and agency interest (
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA TOPS&lt;/a>,

The talk ended with a call to action for the diverse communities represented at the Symposium to improve the ways we do science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="things-we-learned">
Things we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#things-we-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Our experience with the Symposium taught 2i2c a few things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned that our engineering team can rapidly deploy interactive computing resources to support a research and education community. Along the way, we confirmed what we&amp;rsquo;ve been learning from Pangeo and the neuroscience communities: flexible methods to customize the software environment are necessary. We confirmed that our developing
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/service/shared-responsibility.html?highlight=shared%20responsibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >shared responsibility model&lt;/a>, enabling domain-specific experts to provide curated toolchains for their communities while leveraging 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure expertise, is the right approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned that managing access to the hub using members in a GitHub organization works but involves some toil since organizers had to work through the GitHub invitation process for each participant. We are exploring others ways to systematically grant event participants access to a hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Eddy Symposium experience reminded us that some skill at using &lt;code>git&lt;/code> is vital for collaboration. Fernando&amp;rsquo;s brief introduction to &lt;code>git&lt;/code> provided
&lt;a href="https://jack-eddy-symposium.github.io/intro-git-jupyter/intro-git/git-visuals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the mental model of working on a directed acyclyic graph&lt;/a>. Roving support from Jim and Fernando during the afternoon hackathon sessions normalized the skill level across the groups but not without a few merge conflicts and frustration. Near the beginning of future workshops, we will follow an improved approach aimed at establishing good &lt;code>git&lt;/code> hygeine and familiarity with the collaboration workflow using a simple pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are honored to have had the opportunity to collaborate with the Eddy Symposium team by managing infrastructure and participating in the workshop. We learned a lot about how to support the Helio and adjacent communities, and are proud of the ways in which our infrastructure helped them do their work more openly and effectively. We hope to build on these successes with these and other communities in the future!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo Cloud&lt;/a> is an experimental service providing public cloud-based data-science environments for data-intensive geoscience research.
We have recently finished re-creating the
&lt;a href="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a> community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a> repository.
This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one!
The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community.
It will be available at the same URL (
&lt;a href="https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io&lt;/a>) and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place.
Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work.
Please see
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/migration-of-us-central1-b-gcp-pangeo-io-to-2i2c-infrastructure/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this Discourse thread&lt;/a> as an initial place to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;strong>22nd November 2021&lt;/strong>, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub.
Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">
History of Pangeo Cloud Hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the
&lt;a href="https://annual.ametsoc.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting&lt;/a>; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs.
This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable.
Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure.
However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed.
Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">
The Pangeo-2i2c Partnership
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c&lt;/a> is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows.
We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem.
We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities.
Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project&amp;rsquo;s technical stacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities.
We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/notes-from-the-pangeo-2i2c-kick-off-meeting/1587" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >kick-off thread on Discourse&lt;/a>.
This approach allows each community to focus on it&amp;rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s workflows.
In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c.
Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community.
We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! &amp;#x1f680;&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
