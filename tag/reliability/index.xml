This has driven work in monitoring, alerting, and automating infrastructure so that we resolve small problems before they become big problems. In the last quarter of 2025, we wrapped up this effort by testing the following hypothesis:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We can reduce P1 incidents if we shorten the time to act on current alerts and learnings from prior incidents.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what we accomplished and what we learned.&lt;/p>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a snapshot of our new incident dashboard, which shows high-level trends for the stability of our infrastructure:&lt;/p>

We improved infrastructure reliability for our communities
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-improved-infrastructure-reliability-for-our-communities">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We made several technology and team process improvements that led to these benefits for our communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We are now more likely to catch outages before a community reports them to us.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We are now less likely to have an outage happen more than once, or affect more than one community, because we consistently fix the issues that cause outages.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We saw a consistent drop in critical alerts that required immediate response:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>For August and September we had an average of 7 outages/month (6 from alerts, 1 from community)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>In October, November, and December we had an average of 3 outages/month (9 in October, 0 in November, 1 in December, with only one of these being reported by a community)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="we-became-more-efficient-responsive-and-focused">
We became more efficient, responsive, and focused
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-became-more-efficient-responsive-and-focused">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We also got several team benefits from this work:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We get fewer interruptions and distractions from deeper work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We have clear assignment policies to make it clear who is responsible for acting in response to alerts.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We avoid invisible work from falling down rabbit-holes when responding to outages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We decreased the stress and pressure of doing upgrades, making them easier to split into sprint items and more likely to get done consistently.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;/h3>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Created a
&lt;a href="http://status.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >status page for all 2i2c community hubs&lt;/a>, giving our team and communities visibility into the status of our infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created an alert that triggers when two servers fail to start consecutively in a 30-minute time window.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Improved deployment infrastructure so that we can roll out sub-chart upgrades to individual clusters, allowing us to roll out major changes in batches.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Removed our &amp;ldquo;configurator&amp;rdquo; application from community hubs, because it was causing more confusion than it was resolving.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allowed servers to start even when users hit their storage quotas.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provided a number of upgrades to Kubernetes and the support services that we run alongside each community hub.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="process-improvements">

&lt;li>Defined incident
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/topic/monitoring-alerting/escalation-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >escalation policies&lt;/a> using the
&lt;a href="http://status.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >status page&lt;/a> to calibrate the urgency of our response to the severity of incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Defined &amp;ldquo;on-call&amp;rdquo; procedures so our team knows when and how to be more responsive to outages.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time-boxed our alert response process to avoid accidentally falling down rabbit holes for non-urgent problems.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created a more reliable process for
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/topic/monitoring-alerting/escalation-policies/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >responding to incidents&lt;/a> and writing
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/incident-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >incident reports&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="looking-forward">
Looking forward
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#looking-forward">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>After this push around infrastructure reliability, we&amp;rsquo;re significantly more confident in the stability and transparency of our community hub infrastructure. This will deliver better service for our member communities and free up more of our time to engage with them instead of fighting infrastructure fires.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We will continue to improve our infrastructure, and have a better foundation to do so incrementally in the coming quarters. Here are a few things we&amp;rsquo;d still like to improve:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>We still need to improve how reliably we complete follow-up actions from incidents (e.g., writing incident reports). When a process doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit into planning &amp;amp; scoping ceremonies, we struggle to follow it consistently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We&amp;rsquo;d like to improve our testing framework for major upgrades across all hubs (e.g., Kubernetes version upgrades) to catch bugs before communities do.&lt;/li>

&lt;p>While updating our

The analytics publisher was writing index files to temporary storage before uploading to Google Cloud Storage, but for some reason the upload step stopped working. We
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/3462" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >deployed a fix&lt;/a> that eliminates the temporary files entirely - the code now generates the HTML index as a string in memory and uploads directly.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Port scanning is a common part of network-based exploits, and many server hosts prohibit this activity (including Hetzner, where the 2i2c &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> infrastructure lives). We developed a little tool called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptnono/cryptnono/pull/46" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tcpflowkiller&lt;/a> as part of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptnono/cryptnono" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cryptnono&lt;/a> project (our anti-abuse set of tools for hosted JupyterHub and Binder infrastructure) to automatically kill processes that exhibit port scanning behavior. This reduces the likelihood of triggering our server host&amp;rsquo;s abuse policies and helps keep &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> running reliably.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-this-matters">
Why this matters
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-this-matters">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As providers of public compute, it&amp;rsquo;s our responsibility to make sure people can&amp;rsquo;t use our infrastructure to abuse others. This is part of being responsible citizens of the internet. It also saves us time in dealing with outages because cloud providers (understandably) block access when they suspect there is abuse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hetzner and similar hosts have many benefits (including
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/mybinder-antiabuse-scanning/../binder-singlenode/" >significant cost savings&lt;/a>), and tools like tcpflowkiller help keep hubs and binders running smoothly on such hosts, which have different abuse policies than the big commercial cloud providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>AWS and other cloud providers have proprietary ways to combat abuse (like
&lt;a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/what-is-guardduty.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >AWS GuardDuty&lt;/a>). We could have spent our time investing in developing rules there. Instead, contributing to cryptnono helps provide the same set of features in a cloud-agnostic way, in line with
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/open-practices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our principles&lt;/a> of supporting open infrastructure that gives communities control over their infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tool
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/3436" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >has now been deployed to mybinder.org&lt;/a>, and we&amp;rsquo;ll monitor its effectiveness over time. We may roll this out to 2i2c public BinderHubs in the future based on patterns we observe.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="the-problem">
The Problem
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-problem">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Two of our the communities we serve (
&lt;a href="https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NMFS Openscapes&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://book.cryointhecloud.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a>) reported issues with starting GPU nodes on their hubs. Upon investigation, I discovered that the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cluster autoscaler&lt;/a> seems to not recognize that GPUs were available in the cluster at all suddenly, and hence wasn&amp;rsquo;t provisioning the nodes. A restart of the cluster-autoscaler pod fixed the issue for both these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="an-incomplete-solution">
An incomplete solution
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#an-incomplete-solution">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But is that the end of the story? Not if we want to provide reliable long term infrastructure to communities with minimal
&lt;a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/eliminating-toil/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >toil&lt;/a> on the part of 2i2c engineers!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the engineering principles I&amp;rsquo;m trying to have us more intentionally and structurally embody is the idea that we don&amp;rsquo;t fix individual instances of problems, but &lt;strong>whole classes of problems, rather than just an individual instance of the problem&lt;/strong>. Fixing the immediate issue is &lt;em>not enough&lt;/em> - we need to understand what &lt;strong>class of issues&lt;/strong> was manifesting itself in this particular fashion, and fix &lt;em>that&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-was-the-class-of-issues-we-could-fix-here">
What was the &lt;strong>class of issues&lt;/strong> we could fix here?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-was-the-class-of-issues-we-could-fix-here">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Digging in, I realized that our version of cluster-autoscaler was a little behind and not the latest. I &lt;em>presumed&lt;/em> this was a bug in cluster-autoscaler (given a restart fixed it, implying it is a bug about state). To me, the &lt;em>class of problem&lt;/em> here is that we were not rolling out releases to our &amp;ldquo;supporting infrastructure&amp;rdquo; fast enough. Perhaps if we were on the most recent cluster-autoscaler release, this issue would have never happened.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, this failure to scale up was reported to us by the community rather than by an automated alert. We should change that too!&lt;/p>

I don&amp;rsquo;t want to arbitrarily start doing work that upsets prior committed work from that structure. However, we also treat support requests seriously and try to work them into the sprint. So I timeboxed myself for one hour, and saw what I could accomplish. Turns out, a lot!&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/6183" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >upgraded all our support components&lt;/a>, tested them, and rolled them out to &lt;em>all&lt;/em> our communities! This included upgrading Grafana, Prometheus, nginx-ingress as well as the cluster-autoscaler. This also restarts the cluster-autoscaler across our clusters, fixing this issue for other communities (if any had it).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/6182" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >re-enabled&lt;/a> the automatic once a month PR for upgrading these support tasks. We had switched to doing them on a manual sprint cadence, but clearly that was not fast enough nor automated enough. We will instead work these into the sprint once the bot opens the PR. Credit to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Erik Sundell&lt;/a> for initially setting this up&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/6185" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an issue&lt;/a> to track the alert creation, and put it in our sprint backlog.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>(In an additional fifteen minute timebox) Write this blog post, to communicate out both to the affected communities and others what we have done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>By timeboxing myself, I didn&amp;rsquo;t upset our sprint cadence and was able to continue doing other work I had committed to in the sprint, while also fixing this &lt;em>class of issues&lt;/em> to the best of my ability.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While we have been &lt;em>implicitly&lt;/em> trying to solve whole classes of issues rather than individual instances of an issue as a team for a while, I want us to &lt;em>explicitly&lt;/em> do it from now on. Communicating this out to our communities is an important part of that, as is internal team training. This blog post is the former, and we are continually working on the latter :)&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a single open infrastructure repository&lt;/a>.
This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a short description of what we did and the benefit that it had.
It covers the technical details and provides links to more information about our deployment setup.
We hope that it helps other organizations make similar improvements to their own infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-problem">
Our problem
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-problem">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s problem is similar to that of many large organizations that have independent sub-communities within them.
We must centralize the operation and configuration of JupyterHubs in order to boost our efficiency in developing and operating them, but must also treat these hubs &lt;em>independently&lt;/em> because their user communities are not necessarily related, and because we want communities to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >be able to replicate their infrastructure on their own&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A year ago, we built the first version of our deployment infrastructure at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a>.
Over the last year of operation, we identified a number of major shortcomings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Within a Kubernetes cluster, we deployed hubs sequentially, not in parallel. This grew out of a common practice of
&lt;a href="https://sre.google/workbook/canarying-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Canary deployments&lt;/a> that allowed us to test changes on a &lt;strong>staging hub&lt;/strong> before rolling them out to a &lt;strong>production hub&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We used a single configuration file for all hubs within a cluster, which led to confusion and difficulty in identifying a hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moreover, any change to a hub within a cluster caused a re-deploy of &lt;em>all hubs on that cluster&lt;/em>. This is because we did not know whether a given change touched cluster-wide configuration or hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="our-goal">
Our goal
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-goal">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, we spent several weeks discussing a plan to resolve these major problems - here were our goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We should be able to &lt;strong>upgrade a specific hub&lt;/strong> alone, by inspecting which configuration files have been added or modified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production hubs should be upgraded in parallel&lt;/strong> when they are effectively run independently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should &lt;strong>use staging hubs as &amp;ldquo;canary&amp;rdquo; deployments&lt;/strong> and not continue upgrading production hubs if the staging hub fails.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="an-overview-of-our-changes">
An overview of our changes
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#an-overview-of-our-changes">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>To accomplish this, we needed to identify which hub required an upgrade based on file additions/modifications.
This took a lot of discussion and iteration on design, and so we share it below in the hopes that it is helpful to others!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="improvements-to-our-code-and-structure">
Improvements to our code and structure
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#improvements-to-our-code-and-structure">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We made a few major changes to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the infrastructure repository&lt;/a> to facilitate the deployment logic described above.
Here are the major changes we implemented:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We separated each hub&amp;rsquo;s configuration into its own file, or set of files. For example,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/staging.values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>staging&lt;/code> hub configuration&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We created a separate &lt;code>cluster.yaml&lt;/code> file that holds the canonical list of hubs deployed to that cluster and the configuration file(s) associated with each one. For example,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s GKE cluster configuration&lt;/a>, which contains a reference to the previously mentioned
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml#L14-L26" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >staging hub&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We updated
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/master/deployer" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our deployer module&lt;/a> to do the following things:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inspect the list of files modified in a Pull Request.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From this list, calculate the name of a hub that required an upgrade, and the name of its respective cluster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys changes in parallel for each cluster/hub pair.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to these structural and code changes, we also developed new GitHub Actions workflows that control the entire process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-github-actions-workflow-for-upgrading-our-jupyterhubs">
A GitHub Actions workflow for upgrading our JupyterHubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-github-actions-workflow-for-upgrading-our-jupyterhubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We defined a new GitHub Actions workflow that carries out the logic described above.
These are all defined in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-hubs.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this &lt;code>deploy-hubs.yaml&lt;/code> configuration file&lt;/a>.
Here are the major jobs in this workflow, and what each does:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>generate-jobs&lt;/code>: Generate a list of clusters/hubs that must be upgraded, given the files that are changed in a Pull Request.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Evaluate an input list of added/modified files in a PR&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide if the added/modified files warrant an upgrade of a hub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generate a list of hubs and clusters that require upgrades, and some extra details:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does the support chart that is deployed to the cluster also need an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does a staging hub on this cluster require an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This produced two outputs to be used in subsequent steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &lt;strong>human-readable table&lt;/strong> including information on &lt;em>why&lt;/em> a given deployment requires an upgrade (using the excellent
&lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Rich library&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JSON outputs&lt;/strong> that can be interpreted by GitHub Actions as sets of matrix jobs to run.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks">
Concluding Remarks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#concluding-remarks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We think that this is a nice balance of infrastructure complexity and flexibility.
It allows us to separate the configuration of each hub and cluster, which makes each more maintainable by us, and is more aligned with a community&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >Right to Replicate&lt;/a> their infrastructure.
It allows us to remove the interdependence of deploy jobs that do not &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to be dependent, which makes our deploys more efficient.
Finally, it allows us to make &lt;em>targeted deploys&lt;/em> more effectively, which reduces the amount of toil and unnecessary waiting associated with each change. (It also
&lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-04-22-environmental-sustainability-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >reduces our carbon footprint by reducing unnecessary GitHub Action time&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this is a useful resource for others to follow if they also maintain JupyterHubs for multiple communities.
If you have any ideas of how we could further improve this infrastructure, please reach out on GitHub!
If you know of a community that would like 2i2c to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >manage a hub for your community&lt;/a>, please
