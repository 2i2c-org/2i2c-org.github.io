&lt;a href="" >announced the creation of 2i2c&lt;/a>, a non-profit initiative dedicated to improving and facilitating access to infrastructure for interactive computing workflows in research and education. Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Chan Zuckerberg Initiative&lt;/a>. You can find
&lt;a href="https://cziscience.medium.com/scaling-open-infrastructure-and-reproducibility-in-biomedicine-69546a399747" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CZI&amp;rsquo;s announcement here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The rest of this post is a short run-down of what we&amp;rsquo;ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-big-picture">
The big picture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-big-picture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In recent years, several projects including
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Syzygy&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Berkeley DataHubs&lt;/a> have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below are two keys goals for this grant:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">
Goal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#goal-1-build-capacity-for-jupyter-in-research-and-education">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support
&lt;a href="" >Chris Holdgraf&lt;/a> to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">
Goal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#goal-2-support-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c will offer hosted
&lt;a href="" >interactive computing infrastructure&lt;/a> utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first hire -
&lt;a href="" >Georgiana Dolocan&lt;/a> as an &lt;strong>Open Source Infrastructure Engineer&lt;/strong>. Georgiana has been the
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/the-jupyterhub-and-binder-contributor-in-residence-56708d1e3069" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Contributor in Residence&lt;/a> for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Georgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/outreachy-jupyter-supporting-diversity-in-open-communities-dfa78db4b0bd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an outreachy internship&lt;/a> followed by
&lt;a href="https://blog.jupyter.org/cir-report-i-1ca418c230cd" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a term as Contributor in Residence&lt;/a>. Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the
&lt;a href="https://bids.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Berkeley Institute for Data Science&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://numfocus.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NumFOCUS&lt;/a> for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CZI EOSS grant series&lt;/a> for funding the original Contributor in Residence.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its
&lt;a href="" >JupyterHub pilot deployments&lt;/a> to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please
&lt;a href="" >reach out to 2i2c&lt;/a> and let us know!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally. We also believe it will lead to major advancements in supporting interactive computing workflows for research and education. We look forward to what the next three years will bring!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Tue, 10 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>👋 hey everyone!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;d like to announce the creation of a new non-profit organization&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that we call &lt;strong>2i2c&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c stands for &lt;strong>The International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/strong>. It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you&amp;rsquo;d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out
&lt;a href="https://cfp.jupytercon.com/2020/schedule/presentation/209/2i2c-sustaining-open-source-through-hosted-jupyter-infrastructure-for-research-and-education/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this talk about 2i2c&lt;/a> at JupyterCon 2020:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>
&lt;h2 id="why-create-2i2c">
Why create 2i2c?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-create-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including
&lt;a href="" >bringing data science education to thousands of students&lt;/a>, connecting
&lt;a href="" >geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud&lt;/a>, and providing
&lt;a href="" >federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada&lt;/a>, to name a few.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that &lt;em>development&lt;/em> and &lt;em>support&lt;/em> of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-non-profit">
Why a non-profit?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-a-non-profit">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It may sound strange to create a non-profit initiative when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research and educational communities&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Researchers and educators who need development&lt;/strong>, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that offers development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Open source communities&lt;/strong>, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud providers&lt;/strong>, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Supporters of open source&lt;/strong> who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-we-going-to-do">
What are we going to do?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-we-going-to-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here&amp;rsquo;s a rough picture:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Offer
&lt;a href="" >&lt;strong>hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. These will
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >be entirely open source&lt;/a> and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They&amp;rsquo;ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" >the 2i2c &lt;strong>Right to Replicate&lt;/strong> document&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="" >&lt;strong>collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community&amp;rsquo;s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Provide
&lt;a href="" >&lt;strong>core development and community support&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> for open source projects that we use. While many organizations &lt;em>use&lt;/em> Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they &lt;em>give back&lt;/em> to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="next-steps">
Next steps
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#next-steps">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months. Here&amp;rsquo;s an idea of what we&amp;rsquo;ll be up to next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first step is to &lt;strong>understand how interactive computing can best-serve the research and education communities&lt;/strong>. We know that interactive computing tools work in our specific use-cases, but how do these generalize to other domains or types of organizations? Moreover, how can we improve the open source tools to make them even more customizable for each community?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll begin answering this question through several focused JupyterHub pilots aimed at different use-cases across research and education:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>A &amp;ldquo;Hubs for All&amp;rdquo; pilot for education&lt;/strong>. This will focus on making standard educational environments via JupyterHub accessible to a broad range of educational institutions, in particular, traditionally under-resourced institutions such as community colleges, state colleges, and HBCUs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Research-focused hubs for earth analytics&lt;/strong>. Research requires more complex and customized infrastructure than education, and so we are piloting hub infrastructure for a few specific research communities to understand how we can meet their needs. We will use this to better-understand how 2i2c and support a diverse research community in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JupyterHub development for the Pangeo Project&lt;/strong>. Pangeo has been a collaborator of 2i2c since day one, and we love its vision for large-scale earth analytics via cloud infrastructure. We plan to work closely with Pangeo leadership to work on early development of tools aimed at facilitating scalable computing for research on Pangeo infrastructure. More information about this to come soon.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ll also use these pilots to &lt;strong>develop an organizational sustainability model&lt;/strong> around this infrastructure. It takes expertise to manage and develop cloud infrastructure, and 2i2c wishes to pay market rates for its engineers. How can 2i2c offer services and development in a way that is sustainable both for itself and for other institutions? We&amp;rsquo;ll use these pilots to create a plan for both sustaining and scaling 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s ability to serve institutions and teams.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-do-we-need">
What do we need?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-do-we-need">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c has a long road ahead of it. We cannot take venture capital funding, so we have to raise funds the old-fashioned way. This means that:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you are at an organization interested in purchasing hosted JupyterHub environments from 2i2c, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you are a funder or are otherwise interested in supporting 2i2c with a donation or grant, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If you have experience in sustaining service-based organizations such as 2i2c, and wish to offer your expertise or guidance, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ll likely be hiring in the coming months for open source engineers, with a focus on data science, interactive computing, and the cloud. If you&amp;rsquo;re interested in working for an organization like 2i2c, please
&lt;a href="" >send us an email &lt;i class="fas fa-envelope">&lt;/i>&lt;/a>, and keep an eye on this space as we will post more information soon.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="get-involved">

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#wrapping-up">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We are excited about 2i2c, and believe that it is the right kind of organization to create to support research and education, as well as open source communities in interactive computing. The road ahead is a difficult one, but we&amp;rsquo;re confident that we will hit our stride quickly. Stay tuned for more updates to come.&lt;/p>
