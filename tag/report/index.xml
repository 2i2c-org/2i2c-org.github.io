As the year comes to an end, I want to reflect on the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done in 2024, and where we aim to go in 2025.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-main-idea">
The main idea
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-main-idea">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In 2024, 2i2c reached the point in an organization&amp;rsquo;s lifecycle when a team has grown enough in size and complexity that you must change the ways that you organize. The informal ways that worked as a small group don&amp;rsquo;t suffice anymore, and you have to put more effort into aligning and coordinating everyone to ensure you have the same impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I call this the &amp;ldquo;$1M to $2M budget jump&amp;rdquo;, because organizations seem to hit this point around when your annual budget goes from &lt;code>$1M&lt;/code> to &lt;code>$2M&lt;/code>. Getting to the other side of this gap with an intact runway and team is hard, and I suspect that 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s fully distributed nature means that we hit these scaling milestones earlier than many organizations. For us, this has been a major focus of effort all year, and has involved taking a top-to-bottom look at our plans and ways of working as a team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At an organizational level, this meant a lot of introspection and planning, a few new roles, a few departing team members, a funding crunch, a successful effort to dig out of it, and a new system of work organizing our team. We&amp;rsquo;ll share more about all of this later, but here are the major implications for our team:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;ve raised another $2.2M in funding&lt;/strong> to support our efforts in scaling and sustaining our network of community hubs. This gives us roughly another 2 years of projected runway (with some assumptions about revenue from contracts and grants).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;ve hired and incorporated more strategic and systems-level roles&lt;/strong> to give our team support as it grows: a Product Lead, Delivery Lead / Chief of Staff , and a People operations manager.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;ve re-organized our team into separate product and business development teams&lt;/strong>, in order to focus on &lt;em>providing an excellent technical platform and a collection of services that maximizes community impact&lt;/em>, as well as &lt;em>sustaining this service for our communities&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This has allowed us to more effectively coordinate our service enhancement and development efforts, and increases our ability to deliver improvements to our communities and to upstream projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, our organization has a much stronger foundation to build upon as we continue to grow and refine our sustainability model in 2025. It has positioned us to more effectively deal with the challenges in reaching our next milestones for scale and impact, and gives us the tools to be more adaptive and responsive to community needs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Along the way, we also generated a lot of impact through our collaborations with communities in our network, and in the upstream projects that we support. For more details about our impact, see the summaries below.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="community-impact">
Community impact
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#community-impact">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core mission is to support its network of communities that create and share knowledge with open infrastructure. Here are the highlights of how our community network has grown and had impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, we&amp;rsquo;ve grown our network of hubs and users through several new partnerships. We &lt;strong>grew the number of active hubs from ~75 to ~105&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>grew our end-of-year Monthly Active Users (MAUs) from ~6000 to ~8000&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here are a few community highlights from this year:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We served around 20 communities from Latin America and Africa for the &lt;strong>Catalyst project&lt;/strong>:
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/catalyst-partner-highlights/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/catalyst-partner-highlights/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Our community partner &lt;strong>Openscapes&lt;/strong> were invited to the White House to discuss the importance of open science:

&lt;li>We ran a pilot for an &lt;strong>HHMI-affiliated open source project called Spyglass&lt;/strong> for reproducing their pre-print with a live interactive environment using BinderHub to support publishing infrastructure:
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/hhmi-spyglass-mysql/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/hhmi-spyglass-mysql/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We began a collaboration with &lt;strong>Development Seed&lt;/strong> around the &lt;strong>NASA VEDA&lt;/strong> project, to support them with interactive cloud environments for geospatial research:
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/veda-devseed-collab/index.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/veda-devseed-collab/index.md&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Several members in our community network showed off their work at &lt;strong>AGU 2024&lt;/strong>:
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/agu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/agu/&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We co-organized a workshop alongside &lt;strong>Project Pythia&lt;/strong> to create computational narrative content for geospatial analytics, and upgrade their stack to Jupyter Book 2.0:

Open source technology enhancements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#open-source-technology-enhancements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Our second pillar of impact is to improve the ecosystem of open infrastructure and the open science workflows it enables. We use collaborations with our community partners to drive new cycles of development in open source tools that we support. Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief overview of our impact across the open source ecosystem this year.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Here are a few highlights where we focused our effort this year - each of these efforts required both development with and for our community network, as well as upstream contributions and support:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We released the &lt;strong>JupyterHub Fancy Profiles&lt;/strong> project, which allows for a more flexible and modern interface to launch environments with JupyterHub:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles-rollout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles-rollout/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We used this to allow users to &lt;strong>build and launch custom environments in JupyterHub&lt;/strong> in a way that users can also share with others. Here&amp;rsquo;s a community with which we&amp;rsquo;ve piloted this functionality:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/nasa-ephemeral-hubs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/nasa-ephemeral-hubs/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve added a Grafana dashboard for &lt;strong>resource and cost monitoring with JupyterHub&lt;/strong> to give communities more visibility over their projected cloud costs:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/aws-cost-attribution/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/aws-cost-attribution/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We began &lt;strong>incorporating Jupyter Book 2.0 workflows into our community hubs&lt;/strong> and laid a foundation for enabling our communuty networks to communicate with one another more effectively using the new MyST document engine. Here are two posts about this:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyter-book-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyter-book-2/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>We built &lt;code>frx-challenges&lt;/code>, a tool to help communities host data challenges with secure, automated evaluation of submissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/frx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c.org/blog/2024/frx/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was built in collaboration with the &lt;strong>HHMI Cellmsp Challenge&lt;/strong> competition:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://cellmapchallenge.janelia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cellmapchallenge.janelia.org/&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="looking-to-next-year">
Looking to next year
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#looking-to-next-year">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2025 is going to be a critical year for 2i2c to build upon the work we began in 2024 to achieve a more sustainable and scalable community model. Here are the main areas that will guide our work in the new year and into 2026, pulled from our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/funding-navigation/" >recent proposal from The Navigation Fund&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #1: Delivery&lt;/strong>. Develop the operating structure and team skills to
efficiently scale our product and service delivery.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #2: Product&lt;/strong>. Develop a product system that continuously improves and
delivers value and impact at scale.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Goal #3: Sustainability&lt;/strong>. Build a business model that is competitive and gives
us resources to sustain and scale our service.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These are the key goals 2i2c must achieve in order to ensure that its service remains impactful, sustainable, scalable, and accessible. We believe that we&amp;rsquo;ve laid a strong foundation to get there, and are excited to begin work next year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Overall, 2024 has been a challenging, but also a rewarding year for our team. We&amp;rsquo;ve encountered and successfully worked thorugh a number of scaling challenges, and we&amp;rsquo;ve made significant progress at laying a foundation on which we can build for the years to come.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly proud of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team for all of their hard work this year, and also honored to be working with a network of communities that care about open infrastructure and its value for creating and sharing knowledge with the world. Here&amp;rsquo;s to another year of impact!&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
