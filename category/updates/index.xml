This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner.
Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post is a short description of what we did and the benefit that it had.
It covers the technical details and provides links to more information about our deployment setup.
We hope that it helps other organizations make similar improvements to their own infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-problem">Our problem&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c&amp;rsquo;s problem is similar to that of many large organizations that have independent sub-communities within them.
We must centralize the operation and configuration of JupyterHubs in order to boost our efficiency in developing and operating them, but must also treat these hubs &lt;em>independently&lt;/em> because their user communities are not necessarily related, and because we want communities to &lt;a href="../../right-to-replicate">be able to replicate their infrastructure on their own&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A year ago, we built the first version of our deployment infrastructure at &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a>.
Over the last year of operation, we identified a number of major shortcomings:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Within a Kubernetes cluster, we deployed hubs sequentially, not in parallel. This grew out of a common practice of &lt;a href="https://sre.google/workbook/canarying-releases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canary deployments&lt;/a> that allowed us to test changes on a &lt;strong>staging hub&lt;/strong> before rolling them out to a &lt;strong>production hub&lt;/strong>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We used a single configuration file for all hubs within a cluster, which led to confusion and difficulty in identifying a hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Moreover, any change to a hub within a cluster caused a re-deploy of &lt;em>all hubs on that cluster&lt;/em>. This is because we did not know whether a given change touched cluster-wide configuration or hub-specific configuration.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="our-goal">Our goal&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>So, we spent several weeks discussing a plan to resolve these major problems - here were our goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We should be able to &lt;strong>upgrade a specific hub&lt;/strong> alone, by inspecting which configuration files have been added or modified.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Production hubs should be upgraded in parallel&lt;/strong> when they are effectively run independently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We should &lt;strong>use staging hubs as &amp;ldquo;canary&amp;rdquo; deployments&lt;/strong> and not continue upgrading production hubs if the staging hub fails.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="an-overview-of-our-changes">An overview of our changes&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>To accomplish this, we needed to identify which hub required an upgrade based on file additions/modifications.
This took a lot of discussion and iteration on design, and so we share it below in the hopes that it is helpful to others!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="improvements-to-our-code-and-structure">Improvements to our code and structure&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We made a few major changes to &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the infrastructure repository&lt;/a> to facilitate the deployment logic described above.
Here are the major changes we implemented:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>We separated each hub&amp;rsquo;s configuration into its own file, or set of files. For example, &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/staging.values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>staging&lt;/code> hub configuration&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We created a separate &lt;code>cluster.yaml&lt;/code> file that holds the canonical list of hubs deployed to that cluster and the configuration file(s) associated with each one. For example, &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here is 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s GKE cluster configuration&lt;/a>, which contains a reference to the previously mentioned &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/config/clusters/2i2c/cluster.yaml#L14-L26" target="_blank" rel="noopener">staging hub&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We updated &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/tree/master/deployer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our deployer module&lt;/a> to do the following things:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Inspect the list of files modified in a Pull Request.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From this list, calculate the name of a hub that required an upgrade, and the name of its respective cluster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys changes in parallel for each cluster/hub pair.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>In addition to these structural and code changes, we also developed new GitHub Actions workflows that control the entire process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="a-github-actions-workflow-for-upgrading-our-jupyterhubs">A GitHub Actions workflow for upgrading our JupyterHubs&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We defined a new GitHub Actions workflow that carries out the logic described above.
These are all defined in &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/master/.github/workflows/deploy-hubs.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this &lt;code>deploy-hubs.yaml&lt;/code> configuration file&lt;/a>.
Here are the major jobs in this workflow, and what each does:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>generate-jobs&lt;/code>: Generate a list of clusters/hubs that must be upgraded, given the files that are changed in a Pull Request.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Evaluate an input list of added/modified files in a PR&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Decide if the added/modified files warrant an upgrade of a hub&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Generate a list of hubs and clusters that require upgrades, and some extra details:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Does the support chart that is deployed to the cluster also need an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Does a staging hub on this cluster require an upgrade?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This produced two outputs to be used in subsequent steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &lt;strong>human-readable table&lt;/strong> including information on &lt;em>why&lt;/em> a given deployment requires an upgrade (using the excellent &lt;a href="https://github.com/Textualize/rich" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rich library&lt;/a>).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JSON outputs&lt;/strong> that can be interpreted by GitHub Actions as sets of matrix jobs to run.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

&lt;li>Upgrades a staging hub for the cluster if required (for canary deployments, this is always required if at least one production hub is to be upgraded on the cluster)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;code>filter-generate-jobs&lt;/code>: Allows us to treat the support / staging hubs as canary deployments for all the production hubs on a cluster.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If a staging/support hub deploy fails, removes any jobs for the corresponding cluster.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Allows production deploys to continue on &lt;em>other clusters&lt;/em>.&lt;/li>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="concluding-remarks">Concluding Remarks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We think that this is a nice balance of infrastructure complexity and flexibility.
It allows us to separate the configuration of each hub and cluster, which makes each more maintainable by us, and is more aligned with a community&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="../../right-to-replicate">Right to Replicate&lt;/a> their infrastructure.
It allows us to remove the interdependence of deploy jobs that do not &lt;em>need&lt;/em> to be dependent, which makes our deploys more efficient.
Finally, it allows us to make &lt;em>targeted deploys&lt;/em> more effectively, which reduces the amount of toil and unnecessary waiting associated with each change. (It also &lt;a href="https://github.blog/2021-04-22-environmental-sustainability-github/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reduces our carbon footprint by reducing unnecessary GitHub Action time&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this is a useful resource for others to follow if they also maintain JupyterHubs for multiple communities.
If you have any ideas of how we could further improve this infrastructure, please reach out on GitHub!
If you know of a community that would like 2i2c to &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">manage a hub for your community&lt;/a>, please &lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">send us an email&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

This is a quick post to celebrate the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past three months, and to briefly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main highlights from this quarter - if you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out more of the work that we&amp;rsquo;ve done, see:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-improvements">Infrastructure improvements&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This quarter we did a deep dive into a number of core infrastructure improvements for our &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed JupyterHubs Service&lt;/a>.
Here are a few highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infrastructure reliability and efficiency&lt;/strong>. We &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of our deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>. For example, we refactored our hub configuration so that each community is better-able to track it, we implemented validation steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally push incorrect config to the hubs, and we&amp;rsquo;ve significantly improved our CI/CD pipeline to push deployments out to our hubs more efficiently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automatic deployments to commercial cloud&lt;/strong>. With the ICESat hackweek as a test-case for AWS, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished automating the deployment of clusters and hubs to each major commercial cloud. (there&amp;rsquo;s not a specific issue for this as it has been a multi-month effort over many PRs and issues!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CILogon authentication&lt;/strong>. &lt;a href="https://cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a> is a non-profit organization that provides &amp;ldquo;single-sign on&amp;rdquo; authentication services for the same communities that 2i2c serves. We&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with them to &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/1089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prototype using CILogon for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s hubs&lt;/a>, which should make it much easier for communities to user their own institutional sign-ons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">Communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served and lessons learned&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As described in &lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Managed Hub Services strategy&lt;/a>, our goals for this phase of our organization are to balance &lt;em>serving communities of practice&lt;/em> and &lt;em>learning where we can improve our infrastructure and practices&lt;/em>.
With that in mind, here are a few highlights of communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served, and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We grew a hub for &lt;a href="https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the University of Toronto&lt;/a> to around 4000 monthly users&lt;/strong>. This has taught us a lot about where our support and operations can and cannot scale, and where we have gaps in our sustainability / pricing model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed CILogon on a hub for &lt;a href="https://anu.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a class at Australian National University&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This gives us an opportunity to work out any UX issues and improvements to be made before a deeper CILogon integration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a dedicated database per user for &lt;a href="https://utexas.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a databases course at UT Austin&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This is helping us learn more about how to pair slightly more customized per-user infrastructure with our standard hub setups, as well as how our &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate model&lt;/a> could be followed for more complex setups like a database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We ran an event hub for &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scotty_h_q/status/1508557909751320577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ICESat2 HackWeek&lt;/a> at the University of Washington&lt;/strong>. This helped refine our infrastructure and expertise with AWS, as well as improved our event &amp;ldquo;ready mode&amp;rdquo; practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a new hub for &lt;a href="https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LEAP project&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This has given us an opportunity to prototype new processes for pass-through cloud costs to simplify our deployments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizational improvements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond our technical and community impact work, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of significant organizational improvements as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed a &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new role in Product and Community Management&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re excited for this new hire to spearhead efforts in guiding and developing relationships with the communities we serve, as well as guiding and collaborating with our engineering team in developing our services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Project Manager role&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. Our engineering team had been operating as a largely autonomous and independent group, but we&amp;rsquo;ve realized that we would benefit from someone to help coordinate our actions and plans, especially as we balance more operations/support issues in addition to new development. This new role is an experiment at growing this capacity within our team, in the hopes that we can dedicate a team member to it in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We are still working out our major priorities for the oncoming quarter, but have a few major projects in the works that we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful to make progress on quickly.
Here are a few major examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our process and operations around supporting our users&lt;/strong>. We are &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing first- and second-line support processes&lt;/a> to make our team more responsive and effective at resolving incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and contracting process&lt;/strong>. We are &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing how to reduce toil associated with invoicing&lt;/a> in order to make this practice more reliable and efficient, along with our fiscal sponsor &lt;a href="https://codeforscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving our reporting and monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;d like to boost our ability to &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitor activity on each of our hubs&lt;/a> in order to identify when something abnormal is happening and get ahead of any potential problems (e.g., to avoid unintentionally large cloud bills). We&amp;rsquo;d also like to improve our usage reporting to more create more accurate cloud bills for hubs running on multi-tenant clusters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a lot more planned for 2i2c, and if you&amp;rsquo;re curious to see what we&amp;rsquo;re up to, we invite you to &lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our team compass&lt;/a> to learn about our practices, and &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch our activity on GitHub&lt;/a> to see our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to the amazing 2i2c team, and the multiple open source and scholarly communities that we collaborate with to make all of this possible. In addition, we are grateful to &lt;a href="../../about/funding.md">our funders&lt;/a> for making this possible. We are looking forward to Q2! ð&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Notes from our drop-in meeting about the Product and Community Lead role</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday we had a quick &amp;ldquo;drop-in&amp;rdquo; session to take questions about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a href="../../blog/2022/job-product-community-lead">job posting for a Product and Community Lead&lt;/a>.
We spent the hour discussing a number of questions that others had about the position.
Below is a short overview of the questions and some responses, for those who were not able to attend.
These responses are a bit rough, since they are mostly off-the-cuff based on the questions asked.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update 2022-03-24&lt;/strong>: We&amp;rsquo;ve added extra questions and answers below from our latest drop-in meeting.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-success-look-like-in-the-short-and-long-term">What does success look like in the short and long term?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is an important question, with a few different kinds of answers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As noted, this is the first hire of its kind inside of 2i2c, and it should bring a strategic and organization-building eye to the work that it does.
To some extent, this role will be tasked with coming up with their own answers to these questions.
This person should build a near- and long-term strategy for how Product and Community Engagement should evolve to be most-effective in accomplishing our mission.
This will also mean defining goals and a strategy to meet these goals over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With that in mind, here are a few ideas we have in mind for goals that will drive this role:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>6 month goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Become familiar with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organization, culture, mission, and team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define an early strategy for how you&amp;rsquo;d like to incorporate Product and Community engagement into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s operations, and set some Objectives or Key Results that we should use to measure success. This should include a plan for the two major objectives of this role: guiding and connecting with the communities we serve, and building design and planning processes that bring this perspective into our engineering and services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A few iterations on the execution of this strategy, with some demonstration of impact as well as some documented lessons learned.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>2 year goals&lt;/strong> for this role might be:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>An organizational strategy and structure has been created, defining the various roles that make up this division of 2i2c and their functions.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clearly defined team processes for major programs efforts that this role oversees, as well as interconnections with other major divisions of 2i2c (e.g. engineering or sales). For example, a framework for training community leaders and mechanisms or platforms for communication and engagement with our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A team exists that carries out these efforts, led by the Product and Community Lead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clear demonstrated impact in the communities we serve, according to the OKRs and goals that have been set in this division.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-does-2i2c-provide-mentorshiponboarding">How does 2i2c provide mentorship/onboarding?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>You can find &lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/get-started.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our onboarding process in our Team Compass&lt;/a>.
This roughly comes down to choosing an &amp;ldquo;Onboarding Champion&amp;rdquo; for the new team member, to help walk them through our team processes and get them access to the right information and accounts.
However, 2i2c is quite young, so has only had a few iterations in onboarding new team members.
We look forward to improving this process further via this new hire.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-the-largest-challenges-that-someone-might-face-in-their-first-year-in-this-position">What are the largest challenges that someone might face in their first year in this position?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The largest challenge is largely related to ambiguity and fluidity of this role, due to the fact that 2i2c is small and relatively young.
As noted above, this position will have a great deal of autonomy, and will be expected to show leadership in defining the nature of this work within 2i2c.
This can either be exciting or scary depending on your comfort level with ambiguity!
We recognize that it is an anti-pattern to have roles without clearly-defined measures of success, so we&amp;rsquo;re committed to defining this quickly in partnership with the new hire.
However, we don&amp;rsquo;t want to be overly-prescriptive in this role, because we want it to have space to lead these efforts within 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-do-you-hope-to-protect-the-business-aspects-of-2i2c-if-all-the-tech-is-open-source">How do you hope to protect the &amp;ldquo;business&amp;rdquo; aspects of 2i2c, if all the tech is open source?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>2i2c is to some extent committing to a limiting business model: by respecting the &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>, we &lt;em>encourage&lt;/em> other organizations to perform the exact same kinds of services that 2i2c offers.
However, we believe this is in-line with 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission, and would consider this to be a measure of impact rather than a sustainability problem.
In short: our goal is not to become a tech giant or start-up unicorn, we want to sustain a team with competitive pay, and we want to scale as there is more opportunity to serve new communities.
We believe that the complexity of integrating tools and managing cloud services means that there will always be enough of an opportunity to bring in ample funding for this model.
We also hope that our mission-driven nature and focus on research and education will bring in new kinds of funding opportunities that can sustain 2i2c and its mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-would-applying-the-1000-true-fans-approach-work-in-terms-of-advocacy">How would applying the &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; approach work in terms of advocacy?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1000 true fans&lt;/a> approach suggests that it is enough to leverage the support of &amp;ldquo;1000 true fans&amp;rdquo; to sustain a product or service.
We hadn&amp;rsquo;t considered 2i2c in this light before, but believe it aligns well with our strategy.
A common pattern 2i2c follows is to build connections with &amp;ldquo;champions&amp;rdquo; in the communities that we wish to serve.
These individuals are passionate about open science, open source, and community-led workflows.
They advocate for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s services, and also serve as leaders for the kinds of workflows that 2i2c wishes to enable.
We believe that our mission-alignment with research and education, and our focus on empowering community leaders, will position us to build support and dedicated collaborators across these sectors.
We also hope that by centering Jupyter infrastructure in the services we offer, we can benefit from the recognition and demand for this ecosystem via our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-challenges-have-you-run-into-thus-far">What challenges have you run into thus far?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>There are many things we could respond with here!
In this meeting, we discussed two major challenges we continue to iterate on:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Walking the line between &amp;ldquo;software as a service&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;custom infrastructure&amp;rdquo;&lt;/strong>. 2i2c seeks to run infrastructure &lt;em>on behalf of&lt;/em> other communities, but in a scalable and sustainable way.
This means that we must centralize configuration and deployment, but use a standardized stack that benefits from economies of scale.
This is a complex problem, especially at the interface points with university bureacracies.
For example, many universities require a &lt;em>university email&lt;/em> in order to manage cloud infrastructure in their organization - doing this for each of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers is not a sustainable practice, and we must define creative ways to balance the security concerns of universities with our desire to run &lt;em>their&lt;/em> infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building a distributed organization from scratch&lt;/strong>. The other major challenge we&amp;rsquo;ve faced is simply the act of creating an organization from the ground up.
We have worked together for many years in open source communities, but there&amp;rsquo;s a new degree of complexity when you&amp;rsquo;re all working on the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> service and development efforts.
Throw in a largely asynchronous team split across many time zones, and there are a lot of coordination and planning challenges to overcome.
We have tried many things over the past year (see &lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our latest team practices in the team compass&lt;/a>, but there is still a lot of improvement to make.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="how-crucial-is-a-deep-seated-knowledge-of-jupyter-for-this-role">How crucial is a deep-seated knowledge of Jupyter for this role?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>While it&amp;rsquo;s not strictly required for somebody to have a knowledge of Jupyter, we think it will be an important part of this role (at least from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective).
This position is not an engineer, and won&amp;rsquo;t be expected to understand the inner-workings of Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure.
However, it will be crucial that this role understand what is possible with JupyterHub, Notebooks, Jupyter Book, etc, and develop and teach best-practices in applying these tools for research and education.
They&amp;rsquo;ll need to have a deep &lt;em>intuition&lt;/em> for how to use Jupyter tools, how they should be improved, and how they can be integrated together for new services (along with other tools in the open source community).
More important than anything is a deep interest in this ecosystem, and a desire to learn, but having prior experience with the Jupyter stack and similar workflows will be a big benefit.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-level-of-technical-expertise-is-needed-for-this-position">What level of technical expertise is needed for this position?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Ideally, they should have the expertise of a &amp;ldquo;power user&amp;rdquo; of the infrastructure and usecases that we work with.
We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this role to have software development or cloud infrastructure engineering expertise, but they should understand what it is like to &lt;strong>use&lt;/strong> these tools from a user&amp;rsquo;s perspective, and have an intuition about how to improve the workflows.
They should be able to communicate with and collaborate with engineers effectively, so understanding development workflows will be helpful, but they do not need core expertise in software development.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-it-kind-of-like-a-scientific--technical-writer">Is it kind of like a scientific / technical writer?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The skills of a scientific or technical writer would certainly be relevant for this position.
For example, somebody that enjoyed technical documentation or scientific communication likely has one relevant skillset for this role.
However, the role will do much more than &lt;em>just&lt;/em> technical writing - they will also create and execute on organizational strategy, collaborate with our team around designing and planning our work, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="is-scientific-knowledge-in-a-specific-domain-important">Is scientific knowledge in a specific domain important?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We don&amp;rsquo;t expect this person to have deep knowledge in any particular scientific field, though experience with scientific and educational workflows in general will be very beneficial.
2i2c&amp;rsquo;s goal is to build expertise in the aspects of interactive computing workflows that overlap between many research / educational communities.
We hope to work with leaders from these communities to leverage their domain expertise, and to empower them to lead others.
Similar to having technical expertise, the important thing is having an intuition for what it&amp;rsquo;s like to use the infrastructure, what &lt;em>kinds of problems&lt;/em> our target communities are trying to solve, and how to learn more about their perspectives.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-the-role-involve-writing-grants-for-the-sustainability-of-the-project">Does the role involve writing grants for the sustainability of the project?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This role isn&amp;rsquo;t tasked specifically with identifying and writing grants, though it is likely that they will collaborate with others at 2i2c in crafting grant language or pursuing similar opportunities.
2i2c is a small organization and so we all tend to wear many hats, though we try to keep each person&amp;rsquo;s efforts focused on their core responsibilities.
In this case, those responsibilities are community guidance and engagement, as well as service / product design in collaboration with our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-kinds-of-communications-would-this-role-oversee">What kinds of communications would this role oversee?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is hard to know right now and may evolve over time, but we expect this role will primarily communicate with pre-existing communities that we serve.
They will also foster communication between leaders within these communities.
They may interface with communities that 2i2c seeks to serve in the future (for example, in collaboration with sales and partnerships), but their focus will be on cultivating and guiding the communities we already work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="term-for-this-position">Term for this position&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We hire all team members on one-year contracts with an annual review and the expectation to renew the contract for another year (unless we explicitly say otherwise).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-are-the-communities-you-work-with">Where are the communities you work with?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Here are a few characteristics of the communities we &lt;em>currently&lt;/em> work with, though we aspire to broaden this group significantly (for example, we wish to expand our focus outside of North American and Europe):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>They tend to be focused in North America and in Europe (this is likely due to our pre-existing connections)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>They cover a broad range of use-cases, from small- and large-scale education in single institutions, to small- and large-scale research communities that are distributed across the globe.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A common pattern is to work with &amp;ldquo;community champions&amp;rdquo; that are interested in our technology and serve as leaders to bring these workflows to their respective communities. We seek to build more connections with people like this, and cultivate our relationship with them.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Aspirationally, we hope to grow our reach to more communities outside of these countries, in order to achieve our mission of reaching a global audience.
Doing so will require more sophistication in our coordination and pricing, in order to match our services and support model with communities outside of North America and Europe.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="2i2c-is-young-and-without-much-structure-how-do-you-plan-to-add-more-structure-over-time-what-support-will-this-role-have">2i2c is young and without much structure. How do you plan to add more structure over time? What support will this role have?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>This is the first role of its kind, and so you&amp;rsquo;ll need to be comfortable with a relatively fluid environment.
We all believe strongly in building good organizational support structures, but we are a young organization that is still developing this capacity internally.
Your immediate primary support system will be the other strategic leadership of 2i2c - the Executive Director, Steering Council members (on an ad-hoc basis), and other team members.
Over time, we look forward to building more formal support networks between divisions of 2i2c and our team members.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-this-person-need-to-be-on-an-americaeurope-time-zone">Does this person need to be on an America/Europe time zone?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The team is currently distributed between US/Pacific and Eastern European time zones, and this also matches the majority of communities we currently work with, so it will be important for this person to have several hours overlap with at least one of those two (the more the better).
In the short run, it is likely that a person within these time zones will have the least barriers to team and community collaboration.
However, we do not have any strict rules about this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the longer term, we are committed to building distributed team practices that do not cause team members to pay large penalties for being in a particular time zone, and we look forward to finding creative solutions to this challenge.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-are-you-going-to-proceed-now-with-the-applications-youve-received">How are you going to proceed now with the applications youâve received?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We will soon begin reviewing applications on a rolling basis, and will aim for a multi-step interview process that is respectful of the time of each applicant.
More details to come about this, and we&amp;rsquo;ll start sending out communications about applications soon.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>New job posting: Product and Community Lead.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/</link><pubDate>Tue, 22 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/</guid><description>&lt;p>The 2i2c team is looking to hire a new team member! We are seeking a product and community lead with the following two goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Empower the communities we serve to have impact with our infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Guide our development and service design to reflect the needs of our users.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This role will work alongside our engineering team as a partner, and will serve as a high-bandwidth interface to the communities that we work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a link to the full job posting below, the rest of this post is a short rationale for this role, and how we hope it will fit within 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team and strategy.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul class="cta-group">
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="../../jobs/2022/product-community-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="btn btn-primary px-3 py-3">Learn more and apply&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="why-a-new-role">Why a new role?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>When 2i2c began a year ago, we hired a team of engineers that had experience in cloud infrastructure, Jupyter, and open source ecosystems. In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve built out the infrastructure foundation for scalable interactive computing environments that are customizable for the community, and respects their &lt;a href="../../content/right-to-replicate/">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, solely providing infrastructure is not enough. Working with the modern open source stack, using the cloud to its advantage, and bringing these tools into specific domains requires a lot of extra experience and expertise. We believe that 2i2c is in a good position to &lt;strong>provide guidance and support to leaders in the communities that we serve&lt;/strong>, allowing them to get up-to-speed with the infrastructure more effectively so that they can have an impact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve also learned that it&amp;rsquo;s crucial to &lt;strong>develop infrastructure in collaboration with the communities that we&amp;rsquo;re serving&lt;/strong>. A team of engineers tends to focus on code and infrastructure, and having a role that focuses on connecting with communities will give them an excellent perspective on what those communities need.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope that this role will combine these two aspects to create a culture of learning, sharing, and guiding between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team and the communities that we work with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-similar-roles">What are similar roles?&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>We tried to find similar roles in the private and non-profit sector, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t find anything that was a perfect fit. However, there were a few close matches.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is kind-of like a &lt;strong>product manager&lt;/strong> - their job is to understand the communities that we work with, and to use this to help us make decisions about what to build, how to present it, and how to engage with stakeholders. They will need to help us prioritize the work that is most impactful for our mission, and help us navigate trade-offs in the evolution of our services.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This role is also kind-of like a &lt;strong>customer success manager&lt;/strong> or a &lt;strong>developer advocate&lt;/strong> - they will guide and teach those in the communities we serve - particularly community leaders that go on to teach others - how to use our infrastructure most-effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In fact, the closest role we could find is a relatively new one: the &lt;a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/collaboration/research-infrastructure-roles/ram.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Research Applications Manager&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>. This is a role that has been pioneered by the Turing Institute, and is similarly described as a connector that brings together many perspectives and encourages a participatory, team-based approach to research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, the reality is that the person in this role will ultimately get to shape the nature of their work within 2i2c. As a young organization, there is a lot of flexibility for creativity and experimentation in bringing new skillsets into our organization. We hope that the person who fills this role will be excited about growing a culture of team-based approaches to our engineering and collaborations, and to share this culture with the communities that we serve.&lt;/p>

In this year we have grown, experimented, and accomplished a lot - we have also faced challenges and learned as a team. Our primary goal in 2021 was to build a strong foundation for 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To reflect on our work thus far, we&amp;rsquo;re writing three blog posts that describe progress in major areas of work towards this foundation for 2i2c.
These three areas are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Creating services for use-cases&lt;/strong> - these are our first managed infrastructure offerings for communities in research and education.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Developing cloud infrastructure and tools&lt;/strong> - this is the technical backbone that makes these services possible, built entirely on open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Building an organizational foundation&lt;/strong> - this is the creation of our team structures, processes, and culture that help us carry out our mission.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This first post will focus on &lt;strong>services that we&amp;rsquo;ve created in our first year&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ultimately, 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission is to facilitate use-cases in research and education via open source development and services. Throughout 2021 we ran several pilots to learn more about the needs of communities in research and education, and how we could build sustainable services that meet these needs. Here are some highlights for each major use-case we have targeted thus far:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="educational-community-hubs">Educational community hubs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>A primary use-case that 2i2c seeks to enable is &lt;strong>collaborative, distributed educational spaces for learning with data&lt;/strong>. In 2021 we ran several pilots with educational communities:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A university-wide hub for the University of Toronto.&lt;/strong> This hub is used in a variety of classes throughout the university, and is made freely available to anyone with a UofT account. We hope to repeat this model for other university-wide communities, and have learned a lot about the challenges of working with particularly large educational communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Several hubs for community colleges across California.&lt;/strong> In partnership with UC Berkeley and CloudBank, we&amp;rsquo;ve run several hubs for nearly a dozen small community colleges teaching the &lt;a href="http://data8.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Data 8 curriculum&lt;/a> for their students. These hubs are lightweight and offer standardized environments for their students to use, in order to lower the cost of deploying and maintaining the hubs over time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned">What we learned&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>The organizational context around educational use-cases is different from research communities. Compared with research groups, educucational groups have more variance in their size (classes as small as 10 people and as large as 500) and think about cost &lt;strong>by the student&lt;/strong>, not as a lump sum. This means that our initial hub-based pricing model may not map cleanly onto educational contexts, and we need to improve the match of scalability and price to these communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that for these communities, navigating all of the open source tools that are available for pedagogy is confusing! Everybody wants auto-grading but it&amp;rsquo;s unclear what is the &amp;ldquo;right tool for the job&amp;rdquo;. Tools like &lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.github.io/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nbgitpuller&lt;/a> have heavy use at &amp;ldquo;power universities&amp;rdquo; like UC Berkeley, but many others don&amp;rsquo;t know that it exists! We will need to invest more time into building guides and documentation that help others leverage these tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="research-in-the-cloud">Research in the cloud&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to educational use-cases, we ran several pilots for research communities in order to leverage cloud infrastructure for scaling their work or collaborating more effectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We migrated Pangeoâs cloud infrastructure to be run via 2i2c.&lt;/strong> The &lt;a href="https://pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Community&lt;/a> had been operating and developing their own JupyterHub for several years, but were looking for another organization to provide more reliable/sustained operations and support for their Pangeo Cloud Service. This year we migrated the service &lt;a href="../../posts/2021/pangeo-goes-live/">to run off of 2i2câs deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>A scalable cloud hub for a SWOT satellite team&lt;/strong>. The &lt;a href="https://meom-group.github.io/projects/swot-st/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MEOM research group at Grenoble&lt;/a> is doing work with the &lt;a href="https://swot.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA SWOT satellite project&lt;/a>. However, the datasets generated from this project are huge, and only storable via the cloud. We&amp;rsquo;ve set up a JupyterHub to provide cloud-based access to this data, running a Pangeo-like environment.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-1">What we learned&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Research communities tend to have more usecase-specific needs than educational ones. While introductory courses in data science tend to be similar across institutions, research needs are much more unique to the problem and team at hand. Moreover, they tend to want infrastructure that runs via institutional cloud accounts. This is possible due to the flexible nature of Jupyter and JupyterHub, but brings extra challenges in bureacracy and access permissions, given that 2i2c engineers usually are not members of these organizations already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Additionally, many research use-cases are based around the &lt;strong>location of the data&lt;/strong>. This is because data is the hardest thing to move from cloud to cloud. For this reason, it&amp;rsquo;s important to &lt;strong>bring interactive sessions to the data&lt;/strong>. Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s ecosystem makes this possible, but we&amp;rsquo;d like to do more to make this easier. For example, users should be able to launch interactive sessions across many clusters or datacenters, regardless of their hub&amp;rsquo;s location. They should also have more customized control over their environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="distributed-events-and-hackweeks">Distributed events and hackweeks&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally, we had a special use-case that is a hybrid of the previous two examples. Events and hackweeks are &lt;em>time-bounded&lt;/em>, &lt;em>focused on learning and doing&lt;/em>, but often &lt;em>with research workflows and communities&lt;/em>. They also tend to be more globally-distributed than a traditional research or education community.
See below for a few examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="https://coessing.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> workshop is a summer school run in Ghana to share skills and workflows with researchers across Africa. It builds on workflows in the Pangeo ecosystem, and teaches attendees how to work with cloud-native data. By using a cloud-based JupyterHub for their workshop, attendees had direct access to data and compute in a way that would have been much more difficult to set up on local infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The &lt;a href="http://linked.earth/paleoHackathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>PaleoHackWeek hackathons&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> were two hackathons around paleo/climate data workflows. They brought together a distributed community and use the 2i2c hub to facilitate the use of the &lt;a href="https://pyleoclim-util.readthedocs.io/en/master/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">paleoclim package&lt;/a> throughout the hackweek.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://www.openscapes.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>OpenScapes&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. They have several cohorts of scientific trainees learning more about adopting open and collaborative workflows, and use a hub managed by 2i2c to provide remote learning environments for their workshops.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-we-learned-2">What we learned&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Initially we assumed that event-based hubs would be similar to educational use-cases. However, in practice they are more complex. First, event organizers have ever-changing communities of users on their hubs. They often want to provide access to many new users in each event, and expect only a small subset to continue using the infrastructure after an event. Finally, one-off events also generate spikes in activity that are more intense than educational use-cases, and warrant more dedicated attention from our engineers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-that-we-faced">Challenges that we faced&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>As we piloted these use-cases, we also ran into a few challenges in designing services around our infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Balancing standard deployments, custom deployments, and scalability&lt;/strong>. Our goal is to centralize our deployment and operations infrastructure in order to reduce the maintenance burden for each community hub. This will allow us to gain economies of scale and lower costs. However, thereâs an inherent tension between scalability and customizability - in order to scale we must standardize the infrastructure we offer, but communities often want environments that are unique to their use-case.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Turning services into sustainability&lt;/strong>. Weâve learned that charging money for things does not come naturally to us. Weâve spent many years building technology and services that were offered freely to the public. This was easy to provide, but difficult to sustain. 2i2câs goal is to offer similar services, but with a sustainability model that allows us to employ team members to do this work, and to grow in the future. Understanding how to pair the right technology, use-case, and service with a particular pricing model is an area where we must learn more.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">Whatâs next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Piloting all of these services taught us a lot about the similarities and differences between each use case. Towards the end of 2021, this led to 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s first collection of &amp;ldquo;service offerings&amp;rdquo; for a Managed Jupyter Service. This includes a 2-by-2 matrix of service options, and a specific price point for each. We have begun offering this service to communities, in order to learn more about the model, the pricing, and any changes that should be made. In early 2022, we hope to expand this group to more communities so that we can test this modelâs ability to scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our next post in this series will focus on the underlying technology that powers the services described above, stay tuned for more!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Cloud&lt;/a> is an experimental service providing public cloud-based data-science environments for data-intensive geoscience research.
We have recently finished re-creating the &lt;a href="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a> community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a> repository.
This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one!
The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community.
It will be available at the same URL (&lt;a href="https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io&lt;/a>) and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place.
Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work.
Please see &lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/migration-of-us-central1-b-gcp-pangeo-io-to-2i2c-infrastructure/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Discourse thread&lt;/a> as an initial place to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;strong>22nd November 2021&lt;/strong>, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub.
Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">History of Pangeo Cloud Hubs&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the &lt;a href="https://annual.ametsoc.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting&lt;/a>; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs.
This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable.
Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure.
However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed.
Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">The Pangeo-2i2c Partnership&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c&lt;/a> is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows.
We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem.
We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities.
Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project&amp;rsquo;s technical stacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities.
We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this &lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/notes-from-the-pangeo-2i2c-kick-off-meeting/1587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kick-off thread on Discourse&lt;/a>.
This approach allows each community to focus on it&amp;rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s workflows.
In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c.
Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community.
We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! ð&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Community update Q3 2021: A new fiscal sponsor, improving our infrastructure, nearing an alpha launch.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we&amp;rsquo;re up to next. In addition, almost all of the work we do is public and discoverable across &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our GitHub repositories&lt;/a>, and is tracked by GitHub issues. &lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=org:2i2c-org&amp;#43;type:issue&amp;#43;is:closed&amp;#43;closed:2021-06-01..2021-10-01&amp;#43;-label:%22type:&amp;#43;team-sync%22&amp;#43;is:issue&amp;amp;type=issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of issues we&amp;rsquo;ve closed in ~Q3&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is amazing how quickly 4 months goes by when you&amp;rsquo;re building an organization from scratch! It seems like only a few weeks ago that we were recapping the beginning of the year in &lt;a href="../six-month-update">our last community update&lt;/a>. Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we&amp;rsquo;ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover major highlights, challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced, and where we&amp;rsquo;re going next.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">Highlights&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="managed-jupyterhub-service">Managed JupyterHub Service&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we&amp;rsquo;ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation across cloud providers&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS&lt;/a> as well as &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure&lt;/a> to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Monitoring and reporting infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We have worked on the JupyterHub &lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>grafana-dashboards&lt;/code> project&lt;/a> to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User environment management&lt;/strong>. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve improved the &lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker GitHub action&lt;/a> to work with more image registries, and created a &lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/hub-user-image-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c user image template repository&lt;/a> for users to re-use for their hubs. See &lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/admin/howto/environment.html#bring-your-own-docker-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the User Environment docs&lt;/a> for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support and collaboration roles&lt;/strong>. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the &lt;strong>community representative&lt;/strong> role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See &lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the user roles documentation&lt;/a> for more information. We have also begun prototyping a &lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshDesk support model&lt;/a> and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pangeo">Pangeo&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are working with &lt;strong>the Pangeo Community&lt;/strong> to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work &lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/16" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in this GitHub Project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="executable-books--jupyter-book">Executable Books / Jupyter Book&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the &lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executable Books Project&lt;/a>. As such, we have begun shifting our attention to &lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for sustaining the project&amp;rsquo;s community beyond this grant&lt;/a>. In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="jupyterhub-community-support">JupyterHub community support&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>We recently collaborated with the JupyterHub community to &lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for two CZI EOSS awards&lt;/a>. Last month, we were notified that &lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/jupyterhub-community-strategic-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our application to support a Community Strategic Lead&lt;/a> was funded! This role will fund Sarah Gibson&amp;rsquo;s time to focus some of her thinking on building community structures and dynamics that are inclusive and sustainable. We&amp;rsquo;ll update with more information as this project starts moving.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="organizational-foundations">Organizational foundations&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>Finally, in addition to our major development and projects, we have also made a lot of progress at an organizational level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>began &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/css-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fiscal sponsorship with Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>. This provides a new organizational and legal home for 2i2c after spending nearly a year receiving &lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical strategic and start-up support&lt;/a> from our previous host, &lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICSI&lt;/a>. We are excited to work with CS&amp;amp;S to create the business infrastructure that will power our managed JupyterHubs service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2i2c team has also been &lt;strong>improving our team planning and coordination processes&lt;/strong>, so that we can more effectively execute on our mission. As a distributed team, we have the challenge of building processes for team communication, coordination, and planning that are distributed and asynchronous. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you can learn more about our coordination processes in &lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Team Compass&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have &lt;strong>improved our organization-wide documentation&lt;/strong> in order to make it easier to navigate between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s various sources of information. We hope that this provides more transparency into what 2i2c is up to and how it is structured, and that it allows us to build more connections between our projects and the broader community. Check out the new documentation landing site at &lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">docs.2i2c.org&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">What&amp;rsquo;s next&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>In addition to making iterative improvements around the projects described above, we have a few major goals for the final quarter of 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>polish and finish the alpha-level deployment infrastructure&lt;/strong> across each of the major cloud providers. Our end goal is to be able to &lt;em>deploy a Kubernetes cluster and a JupyterHub on that cluster with minimal human effort&lt;/em>. This will allow us to serve more communities with fewer human effort per community. This includes migrating JupyterHubs for key communities, such as the Pangeo project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define and begin an alpha-level service&lt;/strong>. This means defining a few specific &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; that 2i2c can offer, as well as a pricing model for each product. Our goals will still be to learn about how this service should evolve, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more specificity about ways that others can engage with us. It will also be an opportunity to scale modestly so that we can improve our infrastructure as-needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define a longer-term vision&lt;/strong> for our Managed JupyterHubs Service, and create a plan for new workflows that we wish to enable via new development. We wish to use our experience in managing JupyterHubs to understand where new open source development would significantly help the communities we serve, and will shift our attention in this direction once we have finished the early stages of making our infrastructure more robust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for some more updates about this service, coming soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-weve-faced">Challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Finally, we want to recognize that there are plenty of challenges along with successes when it comes to having impact! Here are a few of the unexpected challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve faced along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developing and operating multi-cloud infrastructure is a complex process&lt;/strong>. Automating the creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters across each of the major cloud providers has proven to be a lot of work! While it has been necessary to use our pre-existing hubs to provide the opportunity to build this infrastructure, it is a challenge to both &lt;em>build&lt;/em> and &lt;em>operate&lt;/em> infrastructure at the same time. This has lengthened our timelines for when we expect the alpha version of the service to be ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coordinating among a distributed team takes time&lt;/strong>. Each of our team members has been used to working asynchronously with open source communities for many years, and we under-estimated how complex it would be to port this workflow to a distributed team that must coordinate with each other much more closely on a daily basis. Deciding what to work on, how to work on it, and how to help one another take a lot of work when you only share a few hours awake at the same time. For this reason, we have spent a lot of extra energy in our first months as a team to work out &lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team processes for coordination and collaboration&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to design cloud services as a non-profit?&lt;/strong> Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is no clear roadmap for how to build a sustainable cloud service like the one we describe here. 2i2c is somewhere in-between a traditional SaaS company (which tends to provide access to proprietary technology) and a bespoke consultancy (which is more hands-on and custom than we are). Our best explanation for what 2i2c wishes to do is &amp;ldquo;Open source operations/dev-ops as a service&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into either category. This means that we have more &amp;ldquo;unknown unknowns&amp;rdquo; about what kind of service and pricing model we should develop. We hope to begin answering some of these questions in our alpha-level service launch. Stay tuned for more to come!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="get-involved">Get involved&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>Thanks for your interest in 2i2c and the mission that it hopes to accomplish.
We hope that this update has been informative and interesting, and we welcome feedback about any of the information provided. If you&amp;rsquo;d like to help with any of the challenges or efforts described above, we welcome all forms of collaboration, and are happy to chat.

Thanks for reading!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>2i2c launches next phase in partnership with CS&amp;S</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/css-announce/</link><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/css-announce/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>This post was originally written for the &lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>CS&amp;amp;S blog&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code for Science &amp;amp; Society is thrilled to welcome the &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/a> (2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project! After spending a year incubating in the &lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>, where 2i2c &lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received critical startup support&lt;/a>, 2i2c now joins our fiscally sponsored project program to launch their next phase. 2i2c develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing, with a focus on the Jupyter ecosystem and cloud-native workflows in research and education. They will build a cloud services model that respects a communityâs &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate their infrastructure&lt;/a> by providing transparent and customizable JupyterHub deployments on cloud infrastructure that utilize community-driven open source tools. They aim to use the resources generated from this service in order to support the communities that underlie this infrastructure. Read on for more about 2i2câs mission and how CS&amp;amp;S will support their team and vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2câs organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2câs co-founders have co-led for many years, including &lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo Project&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy Project&lt;/a>, the &lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder Project&lt;/a>, and the &lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/a>. These projects follow an âintegrate, customize, and upstreamâ model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CS&amp;amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS&amp;amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS&amp;amp;Sâs other initiatives in this space, including CS&amp;amp;Sâs other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the &lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/cs-s-launches-digital-infrastructure-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Infrastructure Incubator program&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Achieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2câs next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2câs developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you believe that your community would benefit from a hub like this, please &lt;a href="mailto:hello@2i2c.org">reach out to the 2i2c team&lt;/a>, or &lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/#contact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">join their mailing list&lt;/a>. Stay tuned as 2i2c builds its sustainable, scalable, and community-driven platform for interactive computing in the cloud.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
