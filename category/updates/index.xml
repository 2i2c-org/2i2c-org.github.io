In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work serving and growing our interactive computing service, as well as doing some introspection as a team and identifying major next steps moving forward.
More on that in the following sections, but first a short service update.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-has-our-service-evolved-over-the-past-few-months">
How has our service evolved over the past few months?

&lt;h3 id="new-partnerships-and-service-growth">
New partnerships and service growth
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-partnerships-and-service-growth">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our service has grown several new partner communities over the last two quarters. A few notable communities are
&lt;a href="https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the NASA VEDA project&lt;/a>
, a
&lt;a href="https://smithsonian.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team at the Smithsonian&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://ncar-cisl.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team at NCAR&lt;/a>
, and the
&lt;a href="https://hub.ghg.center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Greenhouse Gases Center&lt;/a>
. We are running about &lt;strong>71 hubs across 24 clusters, with about 4000 weekly users&lt;/strong> (
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/kpis/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more usage stats here&lt;/a>
).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also began operations on a major collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa, called
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7025288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Catalyst Project&lt;/a>
.
This team met together for the first time in April, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been laying a foundation for service growth in the first several months.
We are just onboarding our first communities and hope to grow that service in the coming year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to receive some grants around creating content and designing workflows that utilize cloud infrastructure. For example, a
&lt;a href="https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/open-science-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA TOPS grant&lt;/a>
and an upcoming collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Pythia&lt;/a>
around geospatial workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="financial-picture">
Financial picture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#financial-picture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>recovering roughly 40% of our operating costs&lt;/strong> through recurring fees of our managed hub service (making up the remainder in development contracts and grants), and &lt;strong>we&amp;rsquo;ve currently got around 2 years of runway&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, both of these will be lowered soon because we are about to hire for several more positions.
Improvements to our product model will allow us to estimate and recover our service costs more effectively, but we also intend to raise some funds next year to support our efforts in making our service more robust, sustainable, and valuable to communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to strike a proper balance of team (and cost) growth against the financial buffer needed to assure your partners you&amp;rsquo;ll stick around, but we&amp;rsquo;re confident that the new hires described below will serve critical needs for our team and mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more context on why and how we&amp;rsquo;re trying to make up that capacity, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">
How service growth can lead to team stress
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve had a slow-but-steady stream of new communities interested in working with 2i2c for managing cloud infrastructure for interactive computing.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s make it work somehow&amp;rdquo; approach to all of our community partnerships thus far, with the idea that we must use these partnerships to learn what communities want and identify common patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exciting, and we&amp;rsquo;re fortunate to see the interest and growth in our service.
It suggests to us that something about our model is fundamentally right.
Communities really love the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
, and our participatory service model based around upstream contributions, transparency, and shared responsibility is attractive to many in research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, each new community is also a new set of stresses on the technical and social infrastructure of our team.
Without the capacity to manage the demands of the service, you run the risk of over-extending &amp;ndash; and in a worst case scenario, burning out &amp;ndash; your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This became clear in our first in-person team meeting last May.
At that meeting, we realized that many on the team were spending too much of their time &amp;ldquo;reacting&amp;rdquo; to demands from the service.
We also learned that the scope and complexity of our various workstreams had gotten to a size where our informal team structures of work prioritization were no longer adequate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">
Growing the complexity of our team to match the complexity of our service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, for the past several months we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a plan to evolve 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team structure in order to more effectively manage the complexity of our service, and balance long- and short-term thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This began with an organizational audit carried out by
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>
, a consulting group that focuses on tech-for-good and non-profit products and services.
They conducted interviews with everybody on the team, and concluded that we have a few key functions missing that were creating or compounding the stresses people felt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope to make some of their key findings public soon, and in the meantime here is an overview of some highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">
We need a dedicated product functionality
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>First, we realized that we have a number of new &amp;ldquo;signals&amp;rdquo; pushing our service in many different directions.
Some are external - from communities we work with or from funders. Some are internal - from different team member visions of where work is needed.
After growing our service and our team, there are now too many perspectives and voices to balance in an unstructured and purely organic way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>dedicated &amp;ldquo;product function&amp;rdquo; within 2i2c&lt;/strong>.
Its goal will be to serve as an integrator across the many stakeholders that are interested in 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s service, and synthesize a collective product strategy and system of prioritization to move the organization forward.
They&amp;rsquo;ll help 2i2c grow a culture of iteration and decisions that are driven by the needs of our community partners and users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring a Product Lead&lt;/a>
to kick off this effort.

We need a more structured system of work and execution
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-more-structured-system-of-work-and-execution">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Next, we realized that there are many different workstreams we must balance simultaneously.
There are new communities to be onboarded, infrastructure bugs to be fixed, questions to be answered, and strategic priorities to improve the service.
Expecting each team member to individually find the right balance between all of these is increasingly unrealistic.
We need capacity to oversee this system of work and bring some structure to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>Delivery Manager role&lt;/strong> to oversee the system of work that our engineering team uses for its planning and execution.
In addition, this role will serve at an organization-wide capacity as an &lt;strong>interim Chief of Staff&lt;/strong>.
This will allow them to improve and standardize practices organization-wide, and coordinate major projects that span our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job posting for a Delivery Manager / interrim Chief of Staff&lt;/a>
role.

&lt;h3 id="we-need-more-capacity-to-support-our-team-and-its-individuals">
We need more capacity to support our team and its individuals
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-capacity-to-support-our-team-and-its-individuals">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to moving forward our workstreams, we also have a unique challenge in team support and dynamics.
2i2c is a small team, it is also distributed across 10 time zones!
This adds a lot of extra challenge in getting the team to communicate with one another, support one another as individuals, and learn and grow as a team.
We believe that it&amp;rsquo;s critical to support one another, and to have systems in 2i2c that recognize these challenges in distributed collaboration to design around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re exploring how to create a &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;People Operations&amp;rdquo; function within 2i2c&lt;/strong> that can dedicate their time to supporting 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team as a group as individuals.
This might mean defining creative ways for team-building, creating mechanisms to surface where team members are struggling or need support, and growing best-practices in inclusive asynchronous team culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of designing this role, and hope to have it out in the coming months!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-more-engineering-capacity">
We need more engineering capacity
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-engineering-capacity">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, we also realized we need more cloud engineering capacity on our team, particularly in a timezone that overlaps with the American continents.
This will give our team a bit more breathing room to balance reactive and project-based work, and have more capacity to focus on personal growth and learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find our

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-up-next-for-our-team">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve also adopted a new quarterly planning system to align our team around key goals that deserve focused attention in each quarter.
This will let us be more intentional about considering our work in the context of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s broader opportunities and challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the final quarter of 2023, we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on these key goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Begin to standardize and refine our product offering&lt;/strong>.
In advance of our Product Lead role, we are doing a bit of work to more precisely describe and structure our &lt;em>current&lt;/em> service offering.
Our goal is to lay a foundation that our upcoming Product Lead can then use to learn about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s product and make progress more quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pay down technical debt&lt;/strong>.
Our engineering team is going to focus on streamlining their operations and reducing toil, in order to reduce the number of &amp;ldquo;unexpected distractions&amp;rdquo; that come with inefficient infrastructure and processes.
It will also make the service more reliable and transparent for our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build foundational resources for hub champions to support their community.&lt;/strong>
Our Partnerships team will lead an effort to build basic infrastructure and content that communities can use to create their own knowledge bases around hubs. This will be ongoing work so the goal here is to create a foundation to build upon in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We hope that this has been an informative update from our team, and we appreciate everybody&amp;rsquo;s input and collaboration over the past few months.
We think that the tensions described in this post are healthy - they&amp;rsquo;re reflective of an organization that is growing and reaching organizational milestones.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to tackle them and to continue growing our impact and partnerships.&lt;/p>

As we continue to grow and evolve, it&amp;rsquo;s essential that our branding communicates who we are, what we stand for, and how we envision our future.
We hope that this new design will unify our visual style across the many places where 2i2c operates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In pursuit of these objectives, we teamed up with

We can fly it just about anywhere.
A mark of constant progress &amp;amp; community-driven technology, it isn&amp;rsquo;t stuck to the borders that separate people.
It brings us closer together.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Color is the first visual thing we remember and a powerful asset in building brand recognition.
Our color is blue.
Our community blue says the sky is not the limit. It&amp;rsquo;s energetic and vibrant, just like the community we serve.
And it&amp;rsquo;s our primary colour, supported by a lively secondary palette that&amp;rsquo;s as at home on digital platforms as it is on billboards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve chosen two fonts to use in the majory of the text that we write.
&lt;code>Poppins&lt;/code> for big, bold sentences, and &lt;code>Work Sans&lt;/code> for more versatile and everyday use.&lt;/p>

We like them because they represent 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core mission, which is to build connections between people, computation, and data in order to share open knowledge.
We&amp;rsquo;ll try and think of creative ways to incorporate them into our visual style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe our new visual identity is more than just a fresh coat of paint.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reaffirmation of our commitment to our stakeholders and an exciting milestone in our ongoing journey.
We can&amp;rsquo;t wait for you to see it in action, and are excited to hear what you think about it!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This quarter we grew our engineering team significantly, and started to refine our team processes and structures to accommodate this extra complexity.
We expanded our managed cloud service with new community partners, and made a number of improvements to our technical infrastructure and organizational processes for managing this service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read on below to learn more about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-community-partnerships">
New community partnerships
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-community-partnerships">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We added several new community partnerships to our managed hub service.
We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed new hub infrastructure for each of the following groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our
&lt;a href="https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Toronto Jupyter service&lt;/a>
now has a dedicated R hub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.drakkar-ocean.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drakkar Ocean project&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA Visuaslization Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/quantifiedcarbon/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuantifiedCarbon&lt;/a>
organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://oceanhackweek.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OceanHackWeek 2023&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We onboarded several new community colleges to our &amp;ldquo;JupyterHubs Education in Community Colleges&amp;rdquo; collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://www.cloudbank.org/welcome-cloudbank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudBank&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley CDSS&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="service-improvements">
Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Below are a few highlights for ways in which we improved our
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed Cloud Service&lt;/a>
for our partner communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-simplified-our-authentication-workflow-with-cilogon">
We simplified our authentication workflow with CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-simplified-our-authentication-workflow-with-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Authentication services allow us to identify a user when they log onto a hub, which determines their ability to access hub resources.
Previously we had used a combination of
&lt;a href="https://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auth0&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
, or
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/hub-deployment-guide/configure-auth/github-orgs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub&lt;/a>
for authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with our use of CILogon so far, especially because of its non-profit status and alignment with many research and education institutions that we work with.
This quarter, we decided to streamline our authentication process by dropping the use of Auth0 and grow our partnership with CILogon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>💡 &lt;em>Learn more&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="we-exposed-user-activity-dashboards-in-jupyterhub-so-communities-know-how-many-people-are-using-the-service">
We exposed user activity dashboards in JupyterHub so communities know how many people are using the service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-exposed-user-activity-dashboards-in-jupyterhub-so-communities-know-how-many-people-are-using-the-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We tend to work with &lt;em>leaders&lt;/em> of communities that utilize our service and infrastructure for many others in their network.
For example, a teacher with a classroom of students, or a researcher with a global network of collaborators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to track how many users are actively using a platform over various metrics of time.
This can tell you whether your community finds a service useful, and whether this is growing or shrinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use
&lt;a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana&lt;/a>
to automatically generate dashboards of activity for all of our community hubs and clusters.
However, tracking &lt;strong>daily, weekly, and monthly active users&lt;/strong> was not part of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s core functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to upstream this functionality into JupyterHub and expose it via
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the JupyterHub Grafana project&lt;/a>
.
All 2i2c hubs now track daily, weekly, and monthly unique active users.
And importantly, anybody else deploying the
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero to JupyterHub for Kubernetes&lt;/a>
can use this feature now too.&lt;/p>

We upgraded Kubernetes across all of our AWS clusters
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-upgraded-kubernetes-across-all-of-our-aws-clusters">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes&lt;/a>
is at the core of our cloud infrastructure and scalability.
We use either a shared or a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for each of our community partners, and it is the foundation upon which all of their Jupyter infrastructure rests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest challenges with managing an ongoing cloud service is keeping the underlying infrastructure upgraded.
This brings in new stability and functionality, but also often involves manual steps and toil.
This quarter, we upgraded each of our AWS JupyterHubs to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes 1.24&lt;/a>
and will continue this effort with other providers in the coming quarters.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-streamlined-our-hub-uptime-checks-to-be-more-efficient">
We streamlined our hub uptime checks to be more efficient
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-streamlined-our-hub-uptime-checks-to-be-more-efficient">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The best kinds of failures are ones that your operations team recognizes and solves before any users run into the problem themselves.
We use the
&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Platform HTTP uptime checker&lt;/a>
to
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/topic/monitoring-alerting/uptime-checks.html#simple-https-uptime-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run regular uptime checks for each of the community hubs that we use&lt;/a>
.
This allows us to get quick alerts if any of our community hubs is down for some reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made several optimizations to this process so that we can more efficiently monitor hub uptime and trigger alerts to our engineering team if action is needed.&lt;/p>

Organizational updates

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>2i2c interacts with many open source communities throughout its work, due to the fact that the majority of the improvements we make are done via &lt;strong>upstream contributions&lt;/strong>.
We define
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/mission/#key-stakeholders" target="_blank" rel="noopener">several key open source communities&lt;/a>

.
As our team has grown, we have also had to manage more complexity in communicating and coordinating across a globally-distributed team of engineers.
To help us manage this system, we&amp;rsquo;ve
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/engineering/roles/engineering-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a new Engineering Manager Role&lt;/a>

&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/james-munroe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>James Munroe&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
will lead efforts around &lt;em>community guidance and product design&lt;/em>, and
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/author/jim-colliander/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>Jim Colliander&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
will lead efforts around &lt;em>partnerships and sustainability&lt;/em>. We also
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/436" target="_blank" rel="noopener">updated our Hiring and Candidate Search documentation&lt;/a>
in the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;re refining our strategy&lt;/strong>: We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a process of revisiting and refining our strategy after a year of major operations, see
&lt;a href="../strategic-update/index.md">our strategic update blog post for more information&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We completed the
&lt;a href="https://cscce.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CSCCE&lt;/a>
community management training&lt;/strong>. Two of our team members (James and Sarah) both completed a several-week community management course that was offered in partnership with
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CZI&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our team member Sarah began a part-time role as the JupyterHub Community Strategic Lead&lt;/strong>. Sarah will be leading community strategy efforts within JupyterHub for the next two years thanks to a grant to the JupyterHub team from CZI.

Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We made a number of improvements to our cloud infrastructure and the processes around our service.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief breakdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We expanded our shared clusters to new cloud providers and regions&lt;/strong>. We now have shared clusters already deployed on Google Cloud Platform on &lt;code>us-central1-b&lt;/code> and &lt;code>europe-west2&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We defined an incident commander process&lt;/strong>. This will allow us to coordinate and respond to major outages in our cloud infrastructure more efficiently. See
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/projects/managed-hubs/incidents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our incident response documentation&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We improved our cloud usage monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a centralized Grafana Dashboard&lt;/a>
that aggregates cloud usage across all of our partner communities, and allows us to keep track of any unexpected behavior or outages across them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-were-focusing-next">
Where we&amp;rsquo;re focusing next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#where-were-focusing-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the final quarter of this year, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus our efforts on &lt;strong>growing capacity&lt;/strong> across all of the aspects of our team.
Now that we have brought on several more partner communities into our Managed JupyterHub Service, it has shown us where we have bottlenecks in our technology, process, and structure.
In 2023 we hope to significantly grow the number of communities we work with, and so we must grow our capacity to be able to take on these new partnerships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aim to accomplish this in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make technical improvements&lt;/strong> to our cloud infrastructure that reduces the amount of human labor associated with regular actions. This will make our cloud infrastructure more scalable and reliable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and partnership leads pipeline&lt;/strong> so that we can reduce the amount of administrative toil for ourselves and for the communities we work with in billing and cloud cost pass-through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Refine our organizational strategy and structure&lt;/strong> so that we are better-able to agree on our most important objectives, and to execute on them efficiently as a distributed team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hire people!&lt;/strong> While improving our efficiency will certainly grow our capacity, we also hope to grow our capacity the old fashioned way: by hiring more team members. We&amp;rsquo;re identifying the biggest needs on our team now and will hope to have postings soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="thanks">
Thanks

This is a quick post to celebrate the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past three months, and to briefly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main highlights from this quarter - if you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out more of the work that we&amp;rsquo;ve done, see:&lt;/p>

Infrastructure improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#infrastructure-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This quarter we did a deep dive into a number of core infrastructure improvements for our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed JupyterHubs Service&lt;/a>
.
Here are a few highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infrastructure reliability and efficiency&lt;/strong>. We
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of our deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>
. For example, we refactored our hub configuration so that each community is better-able to track it, we implemented validation steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally push incorrect config to the hubs, and we&amp;rsquo;ve significantly improved our CI/CD pipeline to push deployments out to our hubs more efficiently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automatic deployments to commercial cloud&lt;/strong>. With the ICESat hackweek as a test-case for AWS, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished automating the deployment of clusters and hubs to each major commercial cloud. (there&amp;rsquo;s not a specific issue for this as it has been a multi-month effort over many PRs and issues!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CILogon authentication&lt;/strong>.
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
is a non-profit organization that provides &amp;ldquo;single-sign on&amp;rdquo; authentication services for the same communities that 2i2c serves. We&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with them to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/1089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prototype using CILogon for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s hubs&lt;/a>
, which should make it much easier for communities to user their own institutional sign-ons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">
Communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served and lessons learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As described in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Managed Hub Services strategy&lt;/a>
, our goals for this phase of our organization are to balance &lt;em>serving communities of practice&lt;/em> and &lt;em>learning where we can improve our infrastructure and practices&lt;/em>.
With that in mind, here are a few highlights of communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served, and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We grew a hub for
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the University of Toronto&lt;/a>
to around 4000 monthly users&lt;/strong>. This has taught us a lot about where our support and operations can and cannot scale, and where we have gaps in our sustainability / pricing model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed CILogon on a hub for
&lt;a href="https://anu.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a class at Australian National University&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This gives us an opportunity to work out any UX issues and improvements to be made before a deeper CILogon integration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a dedicated database per user for
&lt;a href="https://utexas.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a databases course at UT Austin&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This is helping us learn more about how to pair slightly more customized per-user infrastructure with our standard hub setups, as well as how our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate model&lt;/a>
could be followed for more complex setups like a database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scotty_h_q/status/1508557909751320577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ICESat2 HackWeek&lt;/a>
at the University of Washington&lt;/strong>. This helped refine our infrastructure and expertise with AWS, as well as improved our event &amp;ldquo;ready mode&amp;rdquo; practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a new hub for
&lt;a href="https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LEAP project&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This has given us an opportunity to prototype new processes for pass-through cloud costs to simplify our deployments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizational improvements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond our technical and community impact work, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of significant organizational improvements as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new role in Product and Community Management&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re excited for this new hire to spearhead efforts in guiding and developing relationships with the communities we serve, as well as guiding and collaborating with our engineering team in developing our services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Project Manager role&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. Our engineering team had been operating as a largely autonomous and independent group, but we&amp;rsquo;ve realized that we would benefit from someone to help coordinate our actions and plans, especially as we balance more operations/support issues in addition to new development. This new role is an experiment at growing this capacity within our team, in the hopes that we can dedicate a team member to it in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We are still working out our major priorities for the oncoming quarter, but have a few major projects in the works that we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful to make progress on quickly.
Here are a few major examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our process and operations around supporting our users&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing first- and second-line support processes&lt;/a>
to make our team more responsive and effective at resolving incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and contracting process&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing how to reduce toil associated with invoicing&lt;/a>
in order to make this practice more reliable and efficient, along with our fiscal sponsor
&lt;a href="https://codeforscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving our reporting and monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;d like to boost our ability to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitor activity on each of our hubs&lt;/a>
in order to identify when something abnormal is happening and get ahead of any potential problems (e.g., to avoid unintentionally large cloud bills). We&amp;rsquo;d also like to improve our usage reporting to more create more accurate cloud bills for hubs running on multi-tenant clusters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a lot more planned for 2i2c, and if you&amp;rsquo;re curious to see what we&amp;rsquo;re up to, we invite you to
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our team compass&lt;/a>
to learn about our practices, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch our activity on GitHub&lt;/a>
to see our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to the amazing 2i2c team, and the multiple open source and scholarly communities that we collaborate with to make all of this possible. In addition, we are grateful to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/organization/funding.md">our funders&lt;/a>
for making this possible. We are looking forward to Q2! 🎉&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Cloud&lt;/a>
is an experimental service providing public cloud-based data-science environments for data-intensive geoscience research.
We have recently finished re-creating the
&lt;a href="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>
community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a>
repository.
This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one!
The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community.
It will be available at the same URL (
&lt;a href="https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io&lt;/a>
) and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place.
Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work.
Please see
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/migration-of-us-central1-b-gcp-pangeo-io-to-2i2c-infrastructure/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Discourse thread&lt;/a>
as an initial place to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;strong>22nd November 2021&lt;/strong>, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub.
Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">
History of Pangeo Cloud Hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the
&lt;a href="https://annual.ametsoc.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting&lt;/a>
; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs.
This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable.
Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure.
However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed.
Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">
The Pangeo-2i2c Partnership
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c&lt;/a>
is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows.
We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem.
We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities.
Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project&amp;rsquo;s technical stacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities.
We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/notes-from-the-pangeo-2i2c-kick-off-meeting/1587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kick-off thread on Discourse&lt;/a>
.
This approach allows each community to focus on it&amp;rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s workflows.
In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c.
Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community.
We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! 🚀&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Community update Q3 2021: A new fiscal sponsor, improving our infrastructure, nearing an alpha launch.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we&amp;rsquo;re up to next. In addition, almost all of the work we do is public and discoverable across
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our GitHub repositories&lt;/a>
, and is tracked by GitHub issues.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=org:2i2c-org&amp;#43;type:issue&amp;#43;is:closed&amp;#43;closed:2021-06-01..2021-10-01&amp;#43;-label:%22type:&amp;#43;team-sync%22&amp;#43;is:issue&amp;amp;type=issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of issues we&amp;rsquo;ve closed in ~Q3&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is amazing how quickly 4 months goes by when you&amp;rsquo;re building an organization from scratch! It seems like only a few weeks ago that we were recapping the beginning of the year in
&lt;a href="../six-month-update">our last community update&lt;/a>
. Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we&amp;rsquo;ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover major highlights, challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced, and where we&amp;rsquo;re going next.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">

&lt;h3 id="managed-jupyterhub-service">
Managed JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we&amp;rsquo;ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation across cloud providers&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS&lt;/a>
as well as
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure&lt;/a>
to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Monitoring and reporting infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We have worked on the JupyterHub
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>grafana-dashboards&lt;/code> project&lt;/a>
to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User environment management&lt;/strong>. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve improved the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker GitHub action&lt;/a>
to work with more image registries, and created a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/hub-user-image-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c user image template repository&lt;/a>
for users to re-use for their hubs. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/environment.html#bring-your-own-docker-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the User Environment docs&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support and collaboration roles&lt;/strong>. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the &lt;strong>community representative&lt;/strong> role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the user roles documentation&lt;/a>
for more information. We have also begun prototyping a
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshDesk support model&lt;/a>
and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents.&lt;/li>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are working with &lt;strong>the Pangeo Community&lt;/strong> to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the
&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executable Books Project&lt;/a>
. As such, we have begun shifting our attention to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for sustaining the project&amp;rsquo;s community beyond this grant&lt;/a>
. In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We recently collaborated with the JupyterHub community to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for two CZI EOSS awards&lt;/a>
. Last month, we were notified that
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/jupyterhub-community-strategic-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our application to support a Community Strategic Lead&lt;/a>
was funded! This role will fund Sarah Gibson&amp;rsquo;s time to focus some of her thinking on building community structures and dynamics that are inclusive and sustainable. We&amp;rsquo;ll update with more information as this project starts moving.&lt;/p>

Organizational foundations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-foundations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, in addition to our major development and projects, we have also made a lot of progress at an organizational level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>began
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/css-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fiscal sponsorship with Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This provides a new organizational and legal home for 2i2c after spending nearly a year receiving
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical strategic and start-up support&lt;/a>
from our previous host,
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICSI&lt;/a>
. We are excited to work with CS&amp;amp;S to create the business infrastructure that will power our managed JupyterHubs service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2i2c team has also been &lt;strong>improving our team planning and coordination processes&lt;/strong>, so that we can more effectively execute on our mission. As a distributed team, we have the challenge of building processes for team communication, coordination, and planning that are distributed and asynchronous. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you can learn more about our coordination processes in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have &lt;strong>improved our organization-wide documentation&lt;/strong> in order to make it easier to navigate between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s various sources of information. We hope that this provides more transparency into what 2i2c is up to and how it is structured, and that it allows us to build more connections between our projects and the broader community.

What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to making iterative improvements around the projects described above, we have a few major goals for the final quarter of 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>polish and finish the alpha-level deployment infrastructure&lt;/strong> across each of the major cloud providers. Our end goal is to be able to &lt;em>deploy a Kubernetes cluster and a JupyterHub on that cluster with minimal human effort&lt;/em>. This will allow us to serve more communities with fewer human effort per community. This includes migrating JupyterHubs for key communities, such as the Pangeo project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define and begin an alpha-level service&lt;/strong>. This means defining a few specific &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; that 2i2c can offer, as well as a pricing model for each product. Our goals will still be to learn about how this service should evolve, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more specificity about ways that others can engage with us. It will also be an opportunity to scale modestly so that we can improve our infrastructure as-needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define a longer-term vision&lt;/strong> for our Managed JupyterHubs Service, and create a plan for new workflows that we wish to enable via new development. We wish to use our experience in managing JupyterHubs to understand where new open source development would significantly help the communities we serve, and will shift our attention in this direction once we have finished the early stages of making our infrastructure more robust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for some more updates about this service, coming soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-weve-faced">
Challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-weve-faced">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we want to recognize that there are plenty of challenges along with successes when it comes to having impact! Here are a few of the unexpected challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve faced along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developing and operating multi-cloud infrastructure is a complex process&lt;/strong>. Automating the creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters across each of the major cloud providers has proven to be a lot of work! While it has been necessary to use our pre-existing hubs to provide the opportunity to build this infrastructure, it is a challenge to both &lt;em>build&lt;/em> and &lt;em>operate&lt;/em> infrastructure at the same time. This has lengthened our timelines for when we expect the alpha version of the service to be ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coordinating among a distributed team takes time&lt;/strong>. Each of our team members has been used to working asynchronously with open source communities for many years, and we under-estimated how complex it would be to port this workflow to a distributed team that must coordinate with each other much more closely on a daily basis. Deciding what to work on, how to work on it, and how to help one another take a lot of work when you only share a few hours awake at the same time. For this reason, we have spent a lot of extra energy in our first months as a team to work out
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team processes for coordination and collaboration&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to design cloud services as a non-profit?&lt;/strong> Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is no clear roadmap for how to build a sustainable cloud service like the one we describe here. 2i2c is somewhere in-between a traditional SaaS company (which tends to provide access to proprietary technology) and a bespoke consultancy (which is more hands-on and custom than we are). Our best explanation for what 2i2c wishes to do is &amp;ldquo;Open source operations/dev-ops as a service&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into either category. This means that we have more &amp;ldquo;unknown unknowns&amp;rdquo; about what kind of service and pricing model we should develop. We hope to begin answering some of these questions in our alpha-level service launch. Stay tuned for more to come!&lt;/p>

.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code for Science &amp;amp; Society is thrilled to welcome the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/a>
(2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project! After spending a year incubating in the
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>
, where 2i2c
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received critical startup support&lt;/a>
, 2i2c now joins our fiscally sponsored project program to launch their next phase. 2i2c develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing, with a focus on the Jupyter ecosystem and cloud-native workflows in research and education. They will build a cloud services model that respects a community’s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate their infrastructure&lt;/a>
by providing transparent and customizable JupyterHub deployments on cloud infrastructure that utilize community-driven open source tools. They aim to use the resources generated from this service in order to support the communities that underlie this infrastructure. Read on for more about 2i2c’s mission and how CS&amp;amp;S will support their team and vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c’s organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2c’s co-founders have co-led for many years, including
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder Project&lt;/a>
, and the
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/a>
. These projects follow an “integrate, customize, and upstream” model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CS&amp;amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS&amp;amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS&amp;amp;S’s other initiatives in this space, including CS&amp;amp;S’s other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the
&lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/cs-s-launches-digital-infrastructure-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Infrastructure Incubator program&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Achieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2c’s next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2c’s developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.&lt;/p>
