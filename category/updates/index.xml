&lt;a href="../../2023/organizational-report/index.md">our 2023 report of organizational strengths and weaknesses&lt;/a>
, describing some improvements we&amp;rsquo;ve made on our team&amp;rsquo;s coordination and delivery&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2023, we
&lt;a href="../../2023/organizational-report/index.md">released a report describing our organizational strengths and weaknesses&lt;/a>
.
This uncovered a key challenge for our team: &lt;strong>improving our coordination and delivery&lt;/strong>.
Over the previous two years, our service had grown significantly in its scope and complexity.
We were working on more than 7 active grants and were serving more than 70 active communities with around 7,000 monthly active users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This was taxing our small team, and we found ourselves struggling to efficiently deliver on our work.
For example, a
&lt;a href="../../2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/index.md">collaboration with GESIS to bring image building functionality to JupyterHub&lt;/a>
took longer than we wished, and we felt that our planning and execution was not transparent enough to their team. In addition, in
&lt;a href="https://catalystproject.cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/a>
we felt that 2i2c was not responsive enough to onboarding and deploying infrastructure for new communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="steps-weve-taken-to-improve-delivery">
Steps we&amp;rsquo;ve taken to improve delivery
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#steps-weve-taken-to-improve-delivery">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>At the beginning of 2024, we hired
&lt;a href="../../../jobs/2023/delivery-manager">our first Delivery Manager and Chief of Staff role&lt;/a>
as well as
&lt;a href="../../../jobs/2023/product-lead">our first Product Lead role&lt;/a>
.
Both of these roles are meant to develop systems and team practices that improve our planning and delivery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In Quarter 1 of 2024, we designed and initiated an organizational transformation with the following goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Provide clarity about our overall organizational goals and strategy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define our near-term goals and major projects that drive our work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Define and prioritize the major work items that feed into these goals.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Break this major work items into actionable items that our team can work on from day to day.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Provide visibility for all of this information across the entire organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Below is a brief description of the major changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve made.
These are still a work in progress, and organizational transformation takes months, if not years, but we hope that this provides a useful snapshot in time as we kick off this process.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="our-system-of-work">
Our system of work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-system-of-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our team-wide system of work can be found in the Team Compass at the link below:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/cross-functional/workflow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://compass.2i2c.org/cross-functional/workflow/&lt;/a>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system of work attempts to link our strategic goals with concrete chunks of work to deliver.
You can see an overview of this system below:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-our-work-system-shows-how-initiatives-are-made-up-of-lists-of-actions-that-accomplish-them-these-actions-are-distributed-across-our-teams-operational-boards-for-delivery">
&lt;div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img alt="Our work system shows how initiatives are made up of lists of actions that accomplish them. These actions are distributed across our team&amp;#39;s operational boards for delivery."

loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
Our work system shows how initiatives are made up of lists of actions that accomplish them. These actions are distributed across our team&amp;rsquo;s operational boards for delivery.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>It is roughly broken down into these major areas:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Our value proposition&lt;/strong>: Our system of delivery starts with a value proposition.
This is a north-star statement for the value that 2i2c aims to provide to our communities in order to achieve our mission.
It is a guiding principle for where we prioritize our time and improve our service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While updating our delivery model, we decided it was time to update the value proposition we&amp;rsquo;d been informally using.
We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of &lt;em>validating this value proposition with communities&lt;/em>, and will share a draft for public comment soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strategic goals and major projects&lt;/strong>: Next we define strategic goals that describe the most important progress we must make as an organization.
This considers our current capabilities and challenges, as well as the major projects that we&amp;rsquo;re already committed to (like grants).
Our initiatives (described below) should each represent progress towards one or more of our goals and major projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Strategic initiatives&lt;/strong>: These are major thrusts of work that represent progress towards our goals.
They range in time from weeks to months, and generally require coordination and action across each of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s functional areas.
Initiatives exist in a dedicated board, where we shape and scope them with enough information to understand them and prioritize.
Once an initiative is in progress, it begins driving work on a two-week planning cycle.
All in-progress initiatives should make up a significant percentage of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s total work allocation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Operational boards&lt;/strong>: Operational boards are used to track our day-to-day workstreams.
We organize into two-week sprints, with a collection of work pulled into each sprint according to in-progress initiatives and the other types of reactive and operational work on our plate (for example, responding to support tickets is reactive work).
Within each initiative, we coordinate across our teams in order to understand the next steps needed and who is responsible for doing it.
This helps teams plan the work for their next iteration.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This system is very much still a work in progress, and we&amp;rsquo;ve already identified a number of ways that we&amp;rsquo;d like to improve it moving forward.
For example, we&amp;rsquo;d like to find more efficient ways of coordinating across our team, and encouraging team members to own their own work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="changes-to-our-team-culture">
Changes to our team culture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#changes-to-our-team-culture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to our system around planning work, we&amp;rsquo;ve also identified a number of ways that we can improve our team&amp;rsquo;s culture related to work.
As a distributed organization, one of our biggest challenges has been the additional friction that comes with communicating across many time zones.
It&amp;rsquo;s much harder to solve a problem or get help when responses come with long gaps of time.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, we&amp;rsquo;ve defined several practices that will help our team members grow their autonomy and independence, while still moving towards the same targets and goals.
This is ongoing work that we aim to continue developing over the next few months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Professional growth&lt;/strong>.
First, we&amp;rsquo;ve started an audit of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational roles and the responsibilities and the pathways for growth with each of them.
This began with our engineering team, but will continue with other areas of the organization as well.
We believe that defining professional growth trajectories will help identify the gaps in our team&amp;rsquo;s skills that make it more difficult to act efficiently and independently.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Giving and receiving feedback&lt;/strong>.
We&amp;rsquo;ve defined team practices around giving feedback, and are encouraging a team culture of regular and constructive feedback to one another.
We know that this will be a long-term investment in team practices, and we believe that any team (especially a distributed one) must be able to rely on its team members to help one another grow.
We&amp;rsquo;ve begun this effort by
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/operations/team-practices/feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">creating a guide to giving feedback for 2i2c&lt;/a>
which we hope will be useful for others as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Decision making&lt;/strong>.
We&amp;rsquo;ve defined a
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/operations/governance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">set of principles around decision making at 2i2c&lt;/a>
that encourage more autonomy and creativity.
In a knowledge-driven field such as ours, it is important that team members have the freedom to be creative and take risks, and that we design systems that are resilient to mistakes.
We aim to make mistakes &lt;em>Safe to Fail&lt;/em> to encourage creativity and learning while de-risking major negative consequences.
This document is a first step towards improving our team-wide practices at taking more initiative and action.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Iterative delivery and process improvement&lt;/strong>.
Across each level of the organisation, we have been experimenting more deliberately with Agile delivery practices. These experiments shape our approach to planning (at both the team and organization-level), visualizing and managing our work streams, and improving our internal product delivery processes. We are agnostic to a specific Agile framework, and have found the most value in blending elements of
&lt;a href="https://asana.com/resources/what-is-kanban" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kanban&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/scrum/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Scrum&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://flightlevels.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flight levels&lt;/a>
. We will continue to experiment with these practices, seeking to find a happy medium for 2i2c. We&amp;rsquo;ll share more on this soon :)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coaching&lt;/strong>.
Some members of our team have also begun benefiting from having regular 1:1 coaching to help their interpersonal development. Our team&amp;rsquo;s coaching support includes work to empower improving self-awareness, overcoming self-limiting challenges and gaining technical leadership mastery.
Coupled with our growing practices around team feedback, we aim to build a culture where team members have both internal and external support to help them grow.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are still in the early days of this transformation. We hope that these practices will improve both our operational efficiency and also create a more enjoyable work environment where team members are empowered to have impact in the ways that they see best. We&amp;rsquo;re excited to lean into these challenges and grow as a team, because this is how we can grow the impact of 2i2c and deliver more value for the communities that we serve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Security report for jupyter-server-proxy: CVE-2024-28179</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/cve-jupyter-server-proxy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/cve-jupyter-server-proxy/</guid><description>
&lt;h2 id="what-happened">
What happened?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, the JupyterHub team discovered a security vulnerability in
&lt;a href="https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> package&lt;/a>
that would allow potential unauthenticated access to a JupyterHub via WebSockets, allowing unauthenticated users to run arbitrary code on the JupyterHub.
&lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> is used by many communities to provide alternative user interfaces like RStudio and remote desktops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This vulnerability was detected by the JupyterHub team, with leadership from 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers. It was resolved through upstream contributions to the JupyterHub project, and we have deployed a fix that mitigates this vulnerability for all the hubs 2i2c manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-this-impact-my-2i2c-community-hub">
Does this impact my 2i2c community hub?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-this-impact-my-2i2c-community-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We do not believe that any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities were impacted by this vulnerability, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/f86d128a0d045163e72802f6df287a6f46d4b738/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a patch&lt;/a>
has now been pushed to all community hubs to resolve this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your community was vulnerable to this problem, you might experience slightly slower startup latency while we work out a long-term solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is a vulnerability in the docker image used by our communities, we will be reaching out over the next few weeks to put a more permanent fix in place.&lt;/p>

for more information about the security vulnerability, including details on the mitigation we have put in place to protect our communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re grateful that the JupyterHub community was quick to acknowledge, respond, and resolve this security vulnerability after it was brought to their attention.
We&amp;rsquo;re also proud that 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers helped the JupyterHub team throughout the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allowed our team to resolve the problem before it impacted any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities.
Because 2i2c community infrastructure is managed in a central location, we were able to resolve this for over 80 communities with a single team rather than expecting each community to learn about and fix this problem on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also believe this reflects the healthy upstream relationships that we hope to encourage with our team&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Open Source strategy and practices&lt;/a>
.
By working with the JupyterHub community and pushing changes upstream, we&amp;rsquo;ve resolved this issue for &lt;em>any&lt;/em> user of &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code>, not just 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s own ecosystem.
In particular, because of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s position running hubs for many communities via Kubernetes, we were able to identify a solution that did not require every user image to be updated (as described in section &lt;strong>For JupyterHub admins of Z2JH installations&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe that all of these lead to a healthier, safer ecosystem of open source tools ❤️.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A three year retrospective report of 2i2c's impact</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/report-czi/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Mar 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/report-czi/</guid><description>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re pleased to share a three-year retrospective report that was created to close-out 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s original

for contributing to this blog post&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mybinder.org&lt;/a>
is a very popular service that allows end users to specify and share the environment (languages, packages, etc) required for their notebooks to run correctly by placing
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#config-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener">configuration files&lt;/a>
they are already familiar with (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> or &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>) along with their notebooks. While not without its own set of challenges, this is extremely powerful because it puts control of the &lt;em>environment&lt;/em> in the hands of the people who write the code. They can customize the environment to fit the needs of their code, instead of having to fit their code into the environment that admins have made available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, mybinder.org (and the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub&lt;/a>
software that powers it) is built for &lt;em>sharing&lt;/em> your work after you are done with it, &lt;em>not&lt;/em> for actively doing work. BinderHubs often do not have persistent storage nor persistent user identity, and UX is centered around &lt;em>ephemeral&lt;/em> interactivity that can be shared with others (via a link), rather than &lt;em>persistent&lt;/em> interactivity that a single user repeatedly comes back to.
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub&lt;/a>
is more commonly used for this kinda workflow, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently have the ability for users to easily build their own environments. Admins who are &lt;em>running&lt;/em> the JupyterHub can make
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#using-multiple-profiles-to-let-users-select-their-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener">multiple environments&lt;/a>
available for users to choose from, but this still puts admins in the critical path for environment customization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/gesis-2i2c-collaboration-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">collaboration&lt;/a>
with
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GESIS&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFDI4DS&lt;/a>
, and
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CESSDA&lt;/a>
, aims to bring this flexibility to JupyterHub directly. We aim to empower users to decide for themselves which applications and dependencies are installed on a per-project basis. Our work enables communities with heterogeneous requirements to share a single Hub. Our approach frees administrators from being overwhelmed by installation requests and transforms the JupyterHub platform into a platform for collaborative computational reproducibility. In this update, we report on our progress and upcoming steps in this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">
What does a BinderHub do, exactly?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is helpful to understand that BinderHub primarily has 3 responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Present a UI to the end user for them to provide details on what to build (this is what you see when you go to mybinder.org)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call out to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
in a scalable way to actually &lt;em>build and push&lt;/em> an image containing the environment for the given repository, and show the user logs as this build process happens. This also allows users to debug issues with their build more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk to a JupyterHub instance to launch a user server with the built docker image, and redirect the user to this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>(2) is really the &lt;em>core&lt;/em> feature of BinderHub, and we settled on figuring out how to make that available to JupyterHub users. It was really important to us that this was also done in a way that can be sustainably used by &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em>, not just 2i2c. This blog post discusses the various improvements to the broad ecosystem of projects in the Jupyter ecosystem to get this done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demo">
Demo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#demo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But first, a very quick demo of how this looks like right now now!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- generated from original .mov screen recording with `ffmpeg -i screencast.mov -c:v libx264 screencast.mp4` -->
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./screencast.mp4" autoplay muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very much a work in progress, but the basic flow can be seen clearly. Users see a Server Options menu after they log into JupyterHub. They can specify the two primary things that determine the server configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The resources allocated (RAM, CPU and maybe GPU)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The environment (container image) used, which can be specified in one of 3 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. A pre-selected list of environments (container images), provided by the administrators who set up this JupyterHub
b. A blank text box where you can enter any publicly available docker image they want
c. A mybinder.org style way to specify a GitHub repository, which will be then dynamically built into a docker image for the user!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what did we need to do to accomplish this, in a way that&amp;rsquo;s very upstream friendly and usable by everyone (and not just 2i2c)?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">
A Standalone &lt;code>binderhub-service&lt;/code> helm chart
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The default upstream
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/tree/main/helm-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a>
&lt;em>includes&lt;/em> a JupyterHub as a dependency, and configures itself to be used primarily in a manner similar to
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mybinder.org&lt;/a>
. As the person who helped make that choice early on, I can tell you why it was made - for convenience! And it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> very convenient, as it allowed us to get mybinder.org going fast. However, it makes it difficult to install a BinderHub service &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub. To this end, we have created a standalone
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/binderhub-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a>
, designed to be installed &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub, so we can use it &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> to build images. This allows the BinderHub instance to be used as a
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub Service&lt;/a>
, which is what we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this helm chart is currently under the 2i2c GitHub org, the hope is that it can eventually migrate to a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/519" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jupyterhub-contrib&lt;/a>
organization (once it is created), or it can become the upstream helm chart for BinderHub if enough work can be done in BinderHub to allow it to serve use cases like mybinder.org.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this work, we also added a way for BinderHub to run in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1647" target="_blank" rel="noopener">API only mode&lt;/a>
, so we can fully turn off the UI &lt;em>and&lt;/em> launching ability of BinderHub. This change decoupled the
&lt;a href="#what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">three responsibilities of BinderHub&lt;/a>
we discussed previously, allowing us to bring our own UI and JupyterHub. BinderHub could now be used &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> for its scalable image building features, which is exactly what we want!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">
Sustainably extending KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We identified KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> feature as the ideal location for UI to dynamically build environments (container images), making it just another &amp;rsquo;environment choice&amp;rsquo; people can choose, along with picking the resources their server needs. From an end-user perspective, it was also the logical place for them to specify a repository to build into an environment, as they could already choose some pre-built environments from here. They can also select other arbitrary resources they want (such as memory, GPU, etc) from here as well. From a maintainer perspective, it helps with long-term maintenance of the JupyterHub projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation of &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> however, was not easy to extend at this point. So
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/724" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this PR&lt;/a>
improved how easy it was to extend it in more complex ways, without making the implementation in KubeSpawner itself complicated. Even though this had &lt;em>no&lt;/em> visible end-user effects, it was an extremely important step in allowing us to experiment with UI in a &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> way without having to rely on upstream. These kinds of changes can sometimes be hard to sell to stakeholders but are extremely important in ensuring a continuous and sustainable relationship with upstream.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">
Implementing &lt;code>unlisted_choice&lt;/code> feature in KubeSpawner
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The profileList feature was built to allow JupyterHub &lt;em>admins&lt;/em> to specify an explicit list of container images the end-user can choose from. It did not have a way for any choice that was &lt;em>not&lt;/em> pre-approved by the admin to be used. We needed this feature since the BinderHub API will build a new docker image for each environment the user wants, and so this can not be chosen from a pre-approved list. We had to safely add this feature to KubeSpawner in such a way that it was generally useful to everyone. Many other communities had been asking for such a feature anyway - the ability to simply &amp;rsquo;type in&amp;rsquo; an image and have that be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA VEDA&lt;/a>
was one such community, so we partnered with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/batpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sanjay Bhangar&lt;/a>
from
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Development Seed&lt;/a>
(an organization that helps run NASA VEDA) to implement this feature. Engineers from 2i2c contributed heavily to this feature as well, and after &lt;em>several&lt;/em> PRs (
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/735" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2&lt;/a>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/774" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener">5&lt;/a>
), this feature is now available for everyone to use!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./screenshot.png" alt="Screenshot of Kubernetes Profiles with Unlisted Choice" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key component of doing &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> upstream work is that every addition needs to be useful by itself for a broad group of people. This change was very helpful for many communities that wanted to allow their users the freedom to pick whatever image they want to use, regardless of wether they wanted to use dynamic image building or not. The broad interest allowed us to build a coalition with other interested parties, and get the change accepted upstream more easily!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhub-fancy-profiles">
&lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-fancy-profiles">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once we had all these pieces in place, it was time to actually work on the frontend UI that would allow users to build images dynamically and launch them. Since this will replace the &amp;lsquo;profileList&amp;rsquo; feature, it should also allow them to select different resources (RAM, CPU, etc) as needed, as well as type in an existing image if they desire. So it was a full re-implementation of the &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> frontend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is ongoing now at the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener">jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/a>
project. It is a pure frontend web application, using modern frontend tooling (
&lt;a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">React&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">webpack&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Babel&lt;/a>
, etc) and written in JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s gone through a few revisions, but the demo provided earlier in the blog post is in its current state. Because the default profileList implementation is pure HTML / CSS with very &lt;em>minimal&lt;/em> JS, it is limited in what kind of UX it could have. &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> aims to be very helpful &lt;em>even&lt;/em> when dynamic image-building features are not enabled on a JupyterHub. We hope to roll this out to a few JupyterHubs and improve it over time based on feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">

npm package
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While building &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>, we wanted to use the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> javascript code used by BinderHub frontend to interact with the BinderHub API, instead of re-implementing it. However, the existing BinderHub JavaScript code was not easily consumable by external projects. We refactored the code, added tests, migrated to use modern JS practices and published the
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterhub/binderhub-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>jupyterhub/@binderhub-client&lt;/code> NPM package&lt;/a>
that can be used not just by &lt;code>jupyerhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> but any external project for talking to the BinderHub API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This had to be done in such a way that current BinderHub installations (such as mybinder.org) do not break. That took quite a few pull requests:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1689" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1&lt;/a>

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#defending-against-cryptojacking-with-cryptnono">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For Open Science to flourish, we need to allow access to resources without login / paywalls wherever possible. A new menace against this has been
&lt;a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Cybercrime/Cryptojacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptojacking&lt;/a>
- where attackers use up any and all available free compute to mine cryptocurrencies. This has affected &lt;em>many&lt;/em> folks on the internet, including
&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-actions-being-actively-abused-to-mine-cryptocurrency-on-github-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub Actions&lt;/a>
and mybinder.org, the primary public BinderHub installation. mybinder.org has some extra protections against cryptojacking that aren&amp;rsquo;t easily usable elsewhere, and this has unfortunately meant that the demo JupyterHubs we have with these features enabled have been behind a login wall. I personally believe login walls are long term antithetical to open science, and so this was an important problem to solve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptnono/cryptnono" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cryptnono&lt;/a>
is an open source project designed to help fight cryptojacking, and as part of this grant we ported some of this functionality out of mybinder.org specific code into cryptnono, so other deployments may also benefit from it! We also migrated to using the super efficient
&lt;a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ebpf&lt;/a>
Linux Kernel subsystem, allowing for more complex heuristics to catch a much broader range of cryptomining activity. We have been slowly tweaking the config on mybinder.org, and it has proven to be very effective! This will be very helpful for &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> who wants to provide a JupyterHub (or any other computational service) without a login wall. If you are interested in using cryptnono in this fashion, please

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideRatio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker-service&lt;/a>
, a separate JupyterHub service that could &lt;em>only&lt;/em> build images. As we worked on it, we realized that it was replicating a lot of features that BinderHub already has, so we pivoted to working on BinderHub directly instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Building off of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a>
. While this already had a nice UI, it would be hard to port it to run on a distributed Kubernetes environment without it becoming a &amp;lsquo;hard fork&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While these did slow down the implementation of the project, it has allowed us to be very confident that the methods we have chosen are long-term sustainable.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>mybinder.org also helps you distribute your &lt;em>content&lt;/em>, not just the environment for your code to run in. Since JupyterHub usually comes with a persistent home directory for the user,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">nbgitpuller&lt;/a>
is commonly used for this purpose instead. We should explore ways to integrate nbgitpuller (and other ways to distribute content) in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More thorough documentation for how you can recreate what is in the demo for yourself in your own JupyterHub installation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better UX for specifying images, including figuring out how to &amp;lsquo;save&amp;rsquo; them for future reuse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better compatibility with mybinder.org, particularly in allowing other sources of environments (not just GitHub, but Zenodo, raw git repositories, etc) and URL compatibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better authentication workflow between the frontend and the BinderHub API.&lt;/li>

We&amp;rsquo;ve decided to experiment with a &lt;strong>monthly community update&lt;/strong> to create a regular cadence of transparency and highlights from 2i2c for our broader community.
This is the first such update, so bear with us as we work out the kinks!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our goal with these updates is to share what stands out at 2i2c - what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned, what we&amp;rsquo;re proud of, where we&amp;rsquo;ve struggled, and where we&amp;rsquo;ve had an impact.
We hope this can be a historical record of &amp;ldquo;what stands out&amp;rdquo; to our team and that it is useful for our broader community to see.
We also want this to be relatively short and to the point to make it sustainable to both write and read.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We&amp;rsquo;d love feedback&lt;/strong> on what else you&amp;rsquo;d like to see.

Rough Numbers
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#rough-numbers">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First off, a few numbers on the scale and status of our interactive computing hub service:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are currently running around &lt;strong>73 JupyterHubs&lt;/strong> that are collectively averaging more than &lt;strong>4000 average monthly users&lt;/strong>.
We have several communities in the educational sector, so October was a peak in the Fall semester of activity.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re recovering roughly &lt;strong>40% of our monthly staffing costs through recurring service revenue&lt;/strong>.
The remainder we&amp;rsquo;re making up with a combination of grants and more focused development contracts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Assuming minimal growth in our service and fundraising, our &lt;strong>runway is roughly until August 2025&lt;/strong> - however, we anticipate this to shrink in the short-term once we make critical new hires in the coming months.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This month our team kicked off the second round of our new quarterly sprints and goals process.
This is an attempt to focus our team around a few goals and sub-teams dedicated to them throughout each quarter.
Our hope is that this allows us to make strategic &amp;ldquo;pushes&amp;rdquo; in directions that feel important for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s operations and the communities we serve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This quarter, we incorporated a lot of learning that took place after our first iteration in Q3 2023.
We are hoping to sharpen up the timing of events throughout the process, including communicating internally and externally about our status (thus, this blog post series).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the next quarter, we aim to build off of this work, and to identify where our future new hires of
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager">Delivery Manager / Interim Chief of Staff&lt;/a>

.
The grant team began its operations last April and spent the first several months creating an onboarding pipeline and rubric for identifying and connecting with communities.
As of October, we&amp;rsquo;ve onboarded our first few communities - there is still a lot of content, training material, and documentation to create, and we will begin iterating on this in collaboration with our early-adopted communities in Q4 2023 and Q1 2024.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>This section describes notable new partnerships and developments with communities in our interactive computing hub service.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We began several new partnerships with communities in the research space this month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The

&lt;p>In addition, we&amp;rsquo;ve celebrated considerable growth in one of our partner communities:
&lt;a href="https://cryointhecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CryoCloud&lt;/a>
.
This community focuses its work around studying the Cryosphere using satellite imagery data.
They&amp;rsquo;ve grown their community hub to roughly 300 users in a year and have piloted several novel interfaces for data analysis in a JupyterHub context, such as using
&lt;a href="https://qgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QGIS&lt;/a>
via a Linux desktop browser.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c team members also gave several talks in October, and you can find links to each of these below:&lt;/p>

What We&amp;rsquo;ve Learned and What Stood Out
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-weve-learned-and-what-stood-out">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;em>These are things that we&amp;rsquo;ve learned in the past month that we&amp;rsquo;re using to improve our service moving forward&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Communities like to define and select their own environments&lt;/strong>.
We began rolling out new functionality to allow communities to &lt;strong>define their user environments on-the-fly&lt;/strong>.
This brings mybinder.org-style environment creation into a JupyterHub, and gives both more control and more visibility into the environments that communities use.
We noticed that this also begins to blur the line between different workflows and types of communities that can be served on a single hub.
It means that a hub is no longer strictly tied to a small number of user environments created for it.
We&amp;rsquo;ll explore the implications of this in the coming months.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We need to improve our billing and invoicing infrastructure&lt;/strong>.
This month we began going through another backlog of cloud infrastructure invoices to send out to communities.
For many communities, 2i2c pays a cloud bill on their behalf and passes through costs directly to them.
This allows them to know exactly what they&amp;rsquo;re paying for.
However, it is also starting to generate a lot of work!
We aim to explore ways to automate and standardize this process in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Digital Public Goods is a concept that resonates with many community leaders&lt;/strong>.
Jim and Chris both gave talks that leaned heavily into the notion of open tools and services as &amp;ldquo;Digital Public Goods&amp;rdquo;.
As public goods, it is important that they remain &amp;ldquo;driven by the public&amp;rdquo; and that they have sustainable and scalable models to grow the value that these goods provide.
We&amp;rsquo;ve noted that this topic resonates heavily with people across the research and education spectrum, and we&amp;rsquo;re considering how to lean into these values more heavily in 2i2c.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open organizational report: Strengths and challenges for 2i2c's team</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>Over the last several months 2i2c has been working with an organizational consulting group called
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Difference Digital&lt;/a>
to help us identify the major opportunities and challenges in our organizational structure and strategy.
The result of this work is a report that describes in detail the major strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities that 2i2c faces. It also recommends major actions to take as an organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c values organizational transparency and a willingness to be honest about where you&amp;rsquo;re struggling.
Stress is a natural part of both individuals and organizations, and should be embraced with the goal of learning and improving.
Moreover, as a young organization 2i2c has benefitted heavily from the documents and learning that &lt;em>other&lt;/em> organizations have made publicly available.
We wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be where we are without building on the backs of others who are willing to share what they&amp;rsquo;ve learned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we are making this organizational audit and report public for anyone to see.
We hope that it provides transparency into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s current status, and that it serves as a useful resource for other non-profits that are growing and facing similar challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10081003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the report on Zenodo&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more background on this report, check out the short description below.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>In April of this year we had our first in-person team meeting.
We were excited and grateful to have the opportunity to speak to each other face-to-face.
We also learned that many people on our team were stressed out!
Our service had grown slow-but-steadily over the previous year, and we were feeling the tension that comes with growing your partnerships without significantly changing your team&amp;rsquo;s capacity or structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to work with an organizational consulting group called
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>
to help us identify where we need to make improvements.
They spent several weeks having one-on-one conversations with each member of the team, as well as doing a broader organizational analysis and comparison to other technical organizations at a similar stage of their lifecycle.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The result of this work was a report that outlines the major opportunities and strengths, as well as challenges and gaps in capacity, that our team currently faces.
It makes a number of recommendations for how we should shift our practices, and importantly it also notes that the only way to gain that capacity is by hiring for new people and skills.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/10081003" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a link to the report on Zenodo&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The immediate result of this work is that we currently have three jobs posted:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead">A Product Lead role&lt;/a>
to help us build a &amp;ldquo;product function&amp;rdquo; within 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager">A Delivery Manager / Chief of Staff role&lt;/a>
to oversee and manage 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s system of work.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/23qq4-open-source-infrastructure-engineer">A cloud and operations engineering role&lt;/a>
to grow our cloud engineering team&amp;rsquo;s capacity in serving communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Our next steps are to fill these positions, and to then begin the work of implementing many of the recommendations that are contained in the report.
We&amp;rsquo;re confident that this is a natural part of being a small and growing organization, and we are grateful for the expertise of
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>

In that time, we&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work serving and growing our interactive computing service, as well as doing some introspection as a team and identifying major next steps moving forward.
More on that in the following sections, but first a short service update.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-has-our-service-evolved-over-the-past-few-months">
How has our service evolved over the past few months?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-has-our-service-evolved-over-the-past-few-months">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="new-partnerships-and-service-growth">
New partnerships and service growth
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-partnerships-and-service-growth">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our service has grown several new partner communities over the last two quarters. A few notable communities are
&lt;a href="https://nasa-veda.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the NASA VEDA project&lt;/a>
, a
&lt;a href="https://smithsonian.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team at the Smithsonian&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://ncar-cisl.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a team at NCAR&lt;/a>
, and the
&lt;a href="https://hub.ghg.center/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">U.S. Greenhouse Gases Center&lt;/a>
. We are running about &lt;strong>71 hubs across 24 clusters, with about 4000 weekly users&lt;/strong> (
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/kpis/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more usage stats here&lt;/a>
).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also began operations on a major collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa, called
&lt;a href="https://zenodo.org/records/7025288" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Catalyst Project&lt;/a>
.
This team met together for the first time in April, and we&amp;rsquo;ve been laying a foundation for service growth in the first several months.
We are just onboarding our first communities and hope to grow that service in the coming year.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve been fortunate to receive some grants around creating content and designing workflows that utilize cloud infrastructure. For example, a
&lt;a href="https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science/open-science-101/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA TOPS grant&lt;/a>
and an upcoming collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Project Pythia&lt;/a>
around geospatial workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="financial-picture">
Financial picture
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#financial-picture">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re &lt;strong>recovering roughly 40% of our operating costs&lt;/strong> through recurring fees of our managed hub service (making up the remainder in development contracts and grants), and &lt;strong>we&amp;rsquo;ve currently got around 2 years of runway&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, both of these will be lowered soon because we are about to hire for several more positions.
Improvements to our product model will allow us to estimate and recover our service costs more effectively, but we also intend to raise some funds next year to support our efforts in making our service more robust, sustainable, and valuable to communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s always difficult to strike a proper balance of team (and cost) growth against the financial buffer needed to assure your partners you&amp;rsquo;ll stick around, but we&amp;rsquo;re confident that the new hires described below will serve critical needs for our team and mission.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For more context on why and how we&amp;rsquo;re trying to make up that capacity, read on&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">
How service growth can lead to team stress
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-service-growth-can-lead-to-team-stress">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve had a slow-but-steady stream of new communities interested in working with 2i2c for managing cloud infrastructure for interactive computing.
We&amp;rsquo;ve taken a &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s make it work somehow&amp;rdquo; approach to all of our community partnerships thus far, with the idea that we must use these partnerships to learn what communities want and identify common patterns.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is exciting, and we&amp;rsquo;re fortunate to see the interest and growth in our service.
It suggests to us that something about our model is fundamentally right.
Communities really love the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate&lt;/a>
, and our participatory service model based around upstream contributions, transparency, and shared responsibility is attractive to many in research and education.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, each new community is also a new set of stresses on the technical and social infrastructure of our team.
Without the capacity to manage the demands of the service, you run the risk of over-extending &amp;ndash; and in a worst case scenario, burning out &amp;ndash; your team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This became clear in our first in-person team meeting last May.
At that meeting, we realized that many on the team were spending too much of their time &amp;ldquo;reacting&amp;rdquo; to demands from the service.
We also learned that the scope and complexity of our various workstreams had gotten to a size where our informal team structures of work prioritization were no longer adequate.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">
Growing the complexity of our team to match the complexity of our service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#growing-the-complexity-of-our-team-to-match-the-complexity-of-our-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So, for the past several months we&amp;rsquo;ve been working on a plan to evolve 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team structure in order to more effectively manage the complexity of our service, and balance long- and short-term thinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This began with an organizational audit carried out by
&lt;a href="https://www.makeadifference.digital/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makeadifference.digital&lt;/a>
, a consulting group that focuses on tech-for-good and non-profit products and services.
They conducted interviews with everybody on the team, and concluded that we have a few key functions missing that were creating or compounding the stresses people felt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope to make some of their key findings public soon (Update: this is now available at
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/organizational-report/">this blog post about the organizational report&lt;/a>
), and in the meantime here is an overview of some highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">
We need a dedicated product functionality
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-dedicated-product-functionality">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>First, we realized that we have a number of new &amp;ldquo;signals&amp;rdquo; pushing our service in many different directions.
Some are external - from communities we work with or from funders. Some are internal - from different team member visions of where work is needed.
After growing our service and our team, there are now too many perspectives and voices to balance in an unstructured and purely organic way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>dedicated &amp;ldquo;product function&amp;rdquo; within 2i2c&lt;/strong>.
Its goal will be to serve as an integrator across the many stakeholders that are interested in 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s service, and synthesize a collective product strategy and system of prioritization to move the organization forward.
They&amp;rsquo;ll help 2i2c grow a culture of iteration and decisions that are driven by the needs of our community partners and users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/product-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hiring a Product Lead&lt;/a>
to kick off this effort.

We need a more structured system of work and execution
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-a-more-structured-system-of-work-and-execution">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Next, we realized that there are many different workstreams we must balance simultaneously.
There are new communities to be onboarded, infrastructure bugs to be fixed, questions to be answered, and strategic priorities to improve the service.
Expecting each team member to individually find the right balance between all of these is increasingly unrealistic.
We need capacity to oversee this system of work and bring some structure to it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re creating a &lt;strong>Delivery Manager role&lt;/strong> to oversee the system of work that our engineering team uses for its planning and execution.
In addition, this role will serve at an organization-wide capacity as an &lt;strong>interim Chief of Staff&lt;/strong>.
This will allow them to improve and standardize practices organization-wide, and coordinate major projects that span our team.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/jobs/2023/delivery-manager/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">job posting for a Delivery Manager / interrim Chief of Staff&lt;/a>
role.
If you think you&amp;rsquo;d be interested, please apply!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-more-capacity-to-support-our-team-and-its-individuals">
We need more capacity to support our team and its individuals
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-capacity-to-support-our-team-and-its-individuals">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In addition to moving forward our workstreams, we also have a unique challenge in team support and dynamics.
2i2c is a small team, it is also distributed across 10 time zones!
This adds a lot of extra challenge in getting the team to communicate with one another, support one another as individuals, and learn and grow as a team.
We believe that it&amp;rsquo;s critical to support one another, and to have systems in 2i2c that recognize these challenges in distributed collaboration to design around them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we&amp;rsquo;re exploring how to create a &lt;strong>&amp;ldquo;People Operations&amp;rdquo; function within 2i2c&lt;/strong> that can dedicate their time to supporting 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s team as a group as individuals.
This might mean defining creative ways for team-building, creating mechanisms to surface where team members are struggling or need support, and growing best-practices in inclusive asynchronous team culture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re in the process of designing this role, and hope to have it out in the coming months!&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-need-more-engineering-capacity">
We need more engineering capacity
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-need-more-engineering-capacity">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, we also realized we need more cloud engineering capacity on our team, particularly in a timezone that overlaps with the American continents.
This will give our team a bit more breathing room to balance reactive and project-based work, and have more capacity to focus on personal growth and learning.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can find our

What&amp;rsquo;s up next for our team?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-up-next-for-our-team">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve also adopted a new quarterly planning system to align our team around key goals that deserve focused attention in each quarter.
This will let us be more intentional about considering our work in the context of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s broader opportunities and challenges.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For the final quarter of 2023, we&amp;rsquo;re focusing on these key goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Begin to standardize and refine our product offering&lt;/strong>.
In advance of our Product Lead role, we are doing a bit of work to more precisely describe and structure our &lt;em>current&lt;/em> service offering.
Our goal is to lay a foundation that our upcoming Product Lead can then use to learn about 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s product and make progress more quickly.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Pay down technical debt&lt;/strong>.
Our engineering team is going to focus on streamlining their operations and reducing toil, in order to reduce the number of &amp;ldquo;unexpected distractions&amp;rdquo; that come with inefficient infrastructure and processes.
It will also make the service more reliable and transparent for our communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build foundational resources for hub champions to support their community.&lt;/strong>
Our Partnerships team will lead an effort to build basic infrastructure and content that communities can use to create their own knowledge bases around hubs. This will be ongoing work so the goal here is to create a foundation to build upon in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We hope that this has been an informative update from our team, and we appreciate everybody&amp;rsquo;s input and collaboration over the past few months.
We think that the tensions described in this post are healthy - they&amp;rsquo;re reflective of an organization that is growing and reaching organizational milestones.
We&amp;rsquo;re excited to tackle them and to continue growing our impact and partnerships.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our logo comprises the &lt;code>International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/code> wordmark, characterized by our interactive &lt;code>i&lt;/code>.
We can fly it just about anywhere.
A mark of constant progress &amp;amp; community-driven technology, it isn&amp;rsquo;t stuck to the borders that separate people.
It brings us closer together.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Color is the first visual thing we remember and a powerful asset in building brand recognition.
Our color is blue.
Our community blue says the sky is not the limit. It&amp;rsquo;s energetic and vibrant, just like the community we serve.
And it&amp;rsquo;s our primary colour, supported by a lively secondary palette that&amp;rsquo;s as at home on digital platforms as it is on billboards.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve chosen two fonts to use in the majory of the text that we write.
&lt;code>Poppins&lt;/code> for big, bold sentences, and &lt;code>Work Sans&lt;/code> for more versatile and everyday use.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>They&amp;rsquo;re the strands that intersect and show how our work and values are interconnected to our community.
We like them because they represent 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core mission, which is to build connections between people, computation, and data in order to share open knowledge.
We&amp;rsquo;ll try and think of creative ways to incorporate them into our visual style.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe our new visual identity is more than just a fresh coat of paint.
It&amp;rsquo;s a reaffirmation of our commitment to our stakeholders and an exciting milestone in our ongoing journey.
We can&amp;rsquo;t wait for you to see it in action, and are excited to hear what you think about it!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This quarter we grew our engineering team significantly, and started to refine our team processes and structures to accommodate this extra complexity.
We expanded our managed cloud service with new community partners, and made a number of improvements to our technical infrastructure and organizational processes for managing this service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Read on below to learn more about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="new-community-partnerships">
New community partnerships
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#new-community-partnerships">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We added several new community partnerships to our managed hub service.
We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed new hub infrastructure for each of the following groups:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Our
&lt;a href="https://act.utoronto.ca/jupyterhub-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">University of Toronto Jupyter service&lt;/a>
now has a dedicated R hub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.drakkar-ocean.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Drakkar Ocean project&lt;/a>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NASA Visuaslization Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We deployed a hub for the
&lt;a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/quantifiedcarbon/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuantifiedCarbon&lt;/a>
organization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://oceanhackweek.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OceanHackWeek 2023&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>We onboarded several new community colleges to our &amp;ldquo;JupyterHubs Education in Community Colleges&amp;rdquo; collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://www.cloudbank.org/welcome-cloudbank" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CloudBank&lt;/a>
and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley CDSS&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="service-improvements">
Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Below are a few highlights for ways in which we improved our
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed Cloud Service&lt;/a>
for our partner communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="we-simplified-our-authentication-workflow-with-cilogon">
We simplified our authentication workflow with CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-simplified-our-authentication-workflow-with-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Authentication services allow us to identify a user when they log onto a hub, which determines their ability to access hub resources.
Previously we had used a combination of
&lt;a href="https://auth0.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Auth0&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
, or
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/hub-deployment-guide/configure-auth/github-orgs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub&lt;/a>
for authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, over the past year we&amp;rsquo;ve been happy with our use of CILogon so far, especially because of its non-profit status and alignment with many research and education institutions that we work with.
This quarter, we decided to streamline our authentication process by dropping the use of Auth0 and grow our partnership with CILogon.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>💡 &lt;em>Learn more&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

We exposed user activity dashboards in JupyterHub so communities know how many people are using the service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-exposed-user-activity-dashboards-in-jupyterhub-so-communities-know-how-many-people-are-using-the-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We tend to work with &lt;em>leaders&lt;/em> of communities that utilize our service and infrastructure for many others in their network.
For example, a teacher with a classroom of students, or a researcher with a global network of collaborators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In these cases, it&amp;rsquo;s useful to track how many users are actively using a platform over various metrics of time.
This can tell you whether your community finds a service useful, and whether this is growing or shrinking.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We use
&lt;a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grafana&lt;/a>
to automatically generate dashboards of activity for all of our community hubs and clusters.
However, tracking &lt;strong>daily, weekly, and monthly active users&lt;/strong> was not part of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s core functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to upstream this functionality into JupyterHub and expose it via
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the JupyterHub Grafana project&lt;/a>
.
All 2i2c hubs now track daily, weekly, and monthly unique active users.
And importantly, anybody else deploying the
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Zero to JupyterHub for Kubernetes&lt;/a>
can use this feature now too.&lt;/p>

We upgraded Kubernetes across all of our AWS clusters

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes&lt;/a>
is at the core of our cloud infrastructure and scalability.
We use either a shared or a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for each of our community partners, and it is the foundation upon which all of their Jupyter infrastructure rests.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the biggest challenges with managing an ongoing cloud service is keeping the underlying infrastructure upgraded.
This brings in new stability and functionality, but also often involves manual steps and toil.
This quarter, we upgraded each of our AWS JupyterHubs to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kubernetes 1.24&lt;/a>
and will continue this effort with other providers in the coming quarters.&lt;/p>

We streamlined our hub uptime checks to be more efficient
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-streamlined-our-hub-uptime-checks-to-be-more-efficient">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The best kinds of failures are ones that your operations team recognizes and solves before any users run into the problem themselves.
We use the
&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/monitoring/uptime-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Cloud Platform HTTP uptime checker&lt;/a>
to
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/topic/monitoring-alerting/uptime-checks.html#simple-https-uptime-checks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run regular uptime checks for each of the community hubs that we use&lt;/a>
.
This allows us to get quick alerts if any of our community hubs is down for some reason.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We made several optimizations to this process so that we can more efficiently monitor hub uptime and trigger alerts to our engineering team if action is needed.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>These are large-scale organizational and strategic efforts that impact all of 2i2c.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We applied for a CZI Grant&lt;/strong>: In partership with The Carpentries, CSCCE, MetaDocencia, Invest in Open Infrastructure, and OpenLifeScience, we

Service improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#service-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We made a number of improvements to our cloud infrastructure and the processes around our service.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a brief breakdown:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We expanded our shared clusters to new cloud providers and regions&lt;/strong>. We now have shared clusters already deployed on Google Cloud Platform on &lt;code>us-central1-b&lt;/code> and &lt;code>europe-west2&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We defined an incident commander process&lt;/strong>. This will allow us to coordinate and respond to major outages in our cloud infrastructure more efficiently. See
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/projects/managed-hubs/incidents.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our incident response documentation&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>We improved our cloud usage monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;ve deployed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a centralized Grafana Dashboard&lt;/a>
that aggregates cloud usage across all of our partner communities, and allows us to keep track of any unexpected behavior or outages across them all.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="where-were-focusing-next">
Where we&amp;rsquo;re focusing next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#where-were-focusing-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In the final quarter of this year, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to focus our efforts on &lt;strong>growing capacity&lt;/strong> across all of the aspects of our team.
Now that we have brought on several more partner communities into our Managed JupyterHub Service, it has shown us where we have bottlenecks in our technology, process, and structure.
In 2023 we hope to significantly grow the number of communities we work with, and so we must grow our capacity to be able to take on these new partnerships.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We aim to accomplish this in a few ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Make technical improvements&lt;/strong> to our cloud infrastructure that reduces the amount of human labor associated with regular actions. This will make our cloud infrastructure more scalable and reliable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and partnership leads pipeline&lt;/strong> so that we can reduce the amount of administrative toil for ourselves and for the communities we work with in billing and cloud cost pass-through.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Refine our organizational strategy and structure&lt;/strong> so that we are better-able to agree on our most important objectives, and to execute on them efficiently as a distributed team.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Hire people!&lt;/strong> While improving our efficiency will certainly grow our capacity, we also hope to grow our capacity the old fashioned way: by hiring more team members. We&amp;rsquo;re identifying the biggest needs on our team now and will hope to have postings soon. Stay tuned!&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="thanks">
Thanks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#thanks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Many thanks to the 2i2c team, our partner communities, our funders, and the many others that have provided us support and guidance. We hope that this update provides a helpful idea of our priorities and major efforts, and we look forward to giving you a new update in Q4!&lt;/p>

This is a quick post to celebrate the work we&amp;rsquo;ve done over the past three months, and to briefly share what we&amp;rsquo;re working on next.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These are the main highlights from this quarter - if you&amp;rsquo;d like to check out more of the work that we&amp;rsquo;ve done, see:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>

&lt;h2 id="infrastructure-improvements">
Infrastructure improvements
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#infrastructure-improvements">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This quarter we did a deep dive into a number of core infrastructure improvements for our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Managed JupyterHubs Service&lt;/a>
.
Here are a few highlights:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Infrastructure reliability and efficiency&lt;/strong>. We
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/879" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improved the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of our deployment infrastructure&lt;/a>
. For example, we refactored our hub configuration so that each community is better-able to track it, we implemented validation steps to ensure that we don&amp;rsquo;t accidentally push incorrect config to the hubs, and we&amp;rsquo;ve significantly improved our CI/CD pipeline to push deployments out to our hubs more efficiently.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automatic deployments to commercial cloud&lt;/strong>. With the ICESat hackweek as a test-case for AWS, we&amp;rsquo;ve finished automating the deployment of clusters and hubs to each major commercial cloud. (there&amp;rsquo;s not a specific issue for this as it has been a multi-month effort over many PRs and issues!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>CILogon authentication&lt;/strong>.
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
is a non-profit organization that provides &amp;ldquo;single-sign on&amp;rdquo; authentication services for the same communities that 2i2c serves. We&amp;rsquo;ve partnered with them to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/1089" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prototype using CILogon for 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s hubs&lt;/a>
, which should make it much easier for communities to user their own institutional sign-ons.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">
Communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served and lessons learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#communities-weve-served-and-lessons-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As described in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/strategy.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Managed Hub Services strategy&lt;/a>
, our goals for this phase of our organization are to balance &lt;em>serving communities of practice&lt;/em> and &lt;em>learning where we can improve our infrastructure and practices&lt;/em>.
With that in mind, here are a few highlights of communities we&amp;rsquo;ve served, and what we&amp;rsquo;ve learned from it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We grew a hub for
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.utoronto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the University of Toronto&lt;/a>
to around 4000 monthly users&lt;/strong>. This has taught us a lot about where our support and operations can and cannot scale, and where we have gaps in our sustainability / pricing model.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed CILogon on a hub for
&lt;a href="https://anu.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a class at Australian National University&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This gives us an opportunity to work out any UX issues and improvements to be made before a deeper CILogon integration.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a dedicated database per user for
&lt;a href="https://utexas.pilot.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a databases course at UT Austin&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This is helping us learn more about how to pair slightly more customized per-user infrastructure with our standard hub setups, as well as how our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate model&lt;/a>
could be followed for more complex setups like a database.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We ran an event hub for
&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/scotty_h_q/status/1508557909751320577" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the ICESat2 HackWeek&lt;/a>
at the University of Washington&lt;/strong>. This helped refine our infrastructure and expertise with AWS, as well as improved our event &amp;ldquo;ready mode&amp;rdquo; practices.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We deployed a new hub for
&lt;a href="https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the LEAP project&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This has given us an opportunity to prototype new processes for pass-through cloud costs to simplify our deployments.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Organizational improvements&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond our technical and community impact work, we&amp;rsquo;ve made a lot of significant organizational improvements as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new role in Product and Community Management&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;re excited for this new hire to spearhead efforts in guiding and developing relationships with the communities we serve, as well as guiding and collaborating with our engineering team in developing our services.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>We designed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/382" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a new Project Manager role&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. Our engineering team had been operating as a largely autonomous and independent group, but we&amp;rsquo;ve realized that we would benefit from someone to help coordinate our actions and plans, especially as we balance more operations/support issues in addition to new development. This new role is an experiment at growing this capacity within our team, in the hopes that we can dedicate a team member to it in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We are still working out our major priorities for the oncoming quarter, but have a few major projects in the works that we&amp;rsquo;re hopeful to make progress on quickly.
Here are a few major examples:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our process and operations around supporting our users&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/1068" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing first- and second-line support processes&lt;/a>
to make our team more responsive and effective at resolving incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve our invoicing and contracting process&lt;/strong>. We are
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/355" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discussing how to reduce toil associated with invoicing&lt;/a>
in order to make this practice more reliable and efficient, along with our fiscal sponsor
&lt;a href="https://codeforscience.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improving our reporting and monitoring infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We&amp;rsquo;d like to boost our ability to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/328" target="_blank" rel="noopener">monitor activity on each of our hubs&lt;/a>
in order to identify when something abnormal is happening and get ahead of any potential problems (e.g., to avoid unintentionally large cloud bills). We&amp;rsquo;d also like to improve our usage reporting to more create more accurate cloud bills for hubs running on multi-tenant clusters.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>There is a lot more planned for 2i2c, and if you&amp;rsquo;re curious to see what we&amp;rsquo;re up to, we invite you to
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out our team compass&lt;/a>
to learn about our practices, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">watch our activity on GitHub&lt;/a>
to see our work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many thanks to the amazing 2i2c team, and the multiple open source and scholarly communities that we collaborate with to make all of this possible. In addition, we are grateful to
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/organization/funding.md">our funders&lt;/a>
for making this possible. We are looking forward to Q2! 🎉&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo Cloud&lt;/a>
is an experimental service providing public cloud-based data-science environments for data-intensive geoscience research.
We have recently finished re-creating the
&lt;a href="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pangeo&lt;/a>
community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a>
repository.
This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one!
The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community.
It will be available at the same URL (
&lt;a href="https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io&lt;/a>
) and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place.
Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work.
Please see
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/migration-of-us-central1-b-gcp-pangeo-io-to-2i2c-infrastructure/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this Discourse thread&lt;/a>
as an initial place to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;strong>22nd November 2021&lt;/strong>, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub.
Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">
History of Pangeo Cloud Hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the

; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs.
This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable.
Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure.
However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed.
Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">
The Pangeo-2i2c Partnership
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c&lt;/a>
is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows.
We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem.
We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities.
Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project&amp;rsquo;s technical stacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities.
We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/notes-from-the-pangeo-2i2c-kick-off-meeting/1587" target="_blank" rel="noopener">kick-off thread on Discourse&lt;/a>
.
This approach allows each community to focus on it&amp;rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s workflows.
In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c.
Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community.
We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! 🚀&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Community update Q3 2021: A new fiscal sponsor, improving our infrastructure, nearing an alpha launch.</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Oct 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we&amp;rsquo;ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we&amp;rsquo;re up to next. In addition, almost all of the work we do is public and discoverable across
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our GitHub repositories&lt;/a>
, and is tracked by GitHub issues.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/search?q=org:2i2c-org&amp;#43;type:issue&amp;#43;is:closed&amp;#43;closed:2021-06-01..2021-10-01&amp;#43;-label:%22type:&amp;#43;team-sync%22&amp;#43;is:issue&amp;amp;type=issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of issues we&amp;rsquo;ve closed in ~Q3&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>It is amazing how quickly 4 months goes by when you&amp;rsquo;re building an organization from scratch! It seems like only a few weeks ago that we were recapping the beginning of the year in
&lt;a href="../six-month-update">our last community update&lt;/a>
. Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we&amp;rsquo;ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We&amp;rsquo;ll cover major highlights, challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced, and where we&amp;rsquo;re going next.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="highlights">
Highlights

&lt;/h2>
&lt;h3 id="managed-jupyterhub-service">
Managed JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managed-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we&amp;rsquo;ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Automation across cloud providers&lt;/strong>. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we&amp;rsquo;ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/627" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AWS&lt;/a>
as well as
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/512" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Azure&lt;/a>
to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Monitoring and reporting infrastructure&lt;/strong>. We have worked on the JupyterHub
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/grafana-dashboards" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>grafana-dashboards&lt;/code> project&lt;/a>
to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>User environment management&lt;/strong>. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve improved the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker GitHub action&lt;/a>
to work with more image registries, and created a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/hub-user-image-template" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c user image template repository&lt;/a>
for users to re-use for their hubs. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/environment.html#bring-your-own-docker-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the User Environment docs&lt;/a>
for more information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Support and collaboration roles&lt;/strong>. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the &lt;strong>community representative&lt;/strong> role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the user roles documentation&lt;/a>
for more information. We have also begun prototyping a
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/support.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FreshDesk support model&lt;/a>
and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="pangeo">
Pangeo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#pangeo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are working with &lt;strong>the Pangeo Community&lt;/strong> to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the &amp;ldquo;old&amp;rdquo; Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the
&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Executable Books Project&lt;/a>
. As such, we have begun shifting our attention to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/meta/issues/493" target="_blank" rel="noopener">create a strategy for sustaining the project&amp;rsquo;s community beyond this grant&lt;/a>
. In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="jupyterhub-community-support">
JupyterHub community support

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We recently collaborated with the JupyterHub community to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/380" target="_blank" rel="noopener">apply for two CZI EOSS awards&lt;/a>
. Last month, we were notified that
&lt;a href="https://chanzuckerberg.com/eoss/proposals/jupyterhub-community-strategic-lead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our application to support a Community Strategic Lead&lt;/a>
was funded! This role will fund Sarah Gibson&amp;rsquo;s time to focus some of her thinking on building community structures and dynamics that are inclusive and sustainable. We&amp;rsquo;ll update with more information as this project starts moving.&lt;/p>

Organizational foundations
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#organizational-foundations">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, in addition to our major development and projects, we have also made a lot of progress at an organizational level.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We &lt;strong>began
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/css-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a fiscal sponsorship with Code for Science and Society&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>. This provides a new organizational and legal home for 2i2c after spending nearly a year receiving
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">critical strategic and start-up support&lt;/a>
from our previous host,
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ICSI&lt;/a>
. We are excited to work with CS&amp;amp;S to create the business infrastructure that will power our managed JupyterHubs service.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The 2i2c team has also been &lt;strong>improving our team planning and coordination processes&lt;/strong>, so that we can more effectively execute on our mission. As a distributed team, we have the challenge of building processes for team communication, coordination, and planning that are distributed and asynchronous. If you&amp;rsquo;re curious, you can learn more about our coordination processes in
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our Team Compass&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have &lt;strong>improved our organization-wide documentation&lt;/strong> in order to make it easier to navigate between 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s various sources of information. We hope that this provides more transparency into what 2i2c is up to and how it is structured, and that it allows us to build more connections between our projects and the broader community.

&lt;h2 id="whats-next">
What&amp;rsquo;s next
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#whats-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In addition to making iterative improvements around the projects described above, we have a few major goals for the final quarter of 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>polish and finish the alpha-level deployment infrastructure&lt;/strong> across each of the major cloud providers. Our end goal is to be able to &lt;em>deploy a Kubernetes cluster and a JupyterHub on that cluster with minimal human effort&lt;/em>. This will allow us to serve more communities with fewer human effort per community. This includes migrating JupyterHubs for key communities, such as the Pangeo project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define and begin an alpha-level service&lt;/strong>. This means defining a few specific &amp;ldquo;products&amp;rdquo; that 2i2c can offer, as well as a pricing model for each product. Our goals will still be to learn about how this service should evolve, but we&amp;rsquo;ll have a bit more specificity about ways that others can engage with us. It will also be an opportunity to scale modestly so that we can improve our infrastructure as-needed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wish to &lt;strong>define a longer-term vision&lt;/strong> for our Managed JupyterHubs Service, and create a plan for new workflows that we wish to enable via new development. We wish to use our experience in managing JupyterHubs to understand where new open source development would significantly help the communities we serve, and will shift our attention in this direction once we have finished the early stages of making our infrastructure more robust.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay tuned for some more updates about this service, coming soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="challenges-weve-faced">
Challenges we&amp;rsquo;ve faced
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#challenges-weve-faced">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Finally, we want to recognize that there are plenty of challenges along with successes when it comes to having impact! Here are a few of the unexpected challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve faced along the way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Developing and operating multi-cloud infrastructure is a complex process&lt;/strong>. Automating the creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters across each of the major cloud providers has proven to be a lot of work! While it has been necessary to use our pre-existing hubs to provide the opportunity to build this infrastructure, it is a challenge to both &lt;em>build&lt;/em> and &lt;em>operate&lt;/em> infrastructure at the same time. This has lengthened our timelines for when we expect the alpha version of the service to be ready.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Coordinating among a distributed team takes time&lt;/strong>. Each of our team members has been used to working asynchronously with open source communities for many years, and we under-estimated how complex it would be to port this workflow to a distributed team that must coordinate with each other much more closely on a daily basis. Deciding what to work on, how to work on it, and how to help one another take a lot of work when you only share a few hours awake at the same time. For this reason, we have spent a lot of extra energy in our first months as a team to work out
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/practices/development.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team processes for coordination and collaboration&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>How to design cloud services as a non-profit?&lt;/strong> Finally, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that there is no clear roadmap for how to build a sustainable cloud service like the one we describe here. 2i2c is somewhere in-between a traditional SaaS company (which tends to provide access to proprietary technology) and a bespoke consultancy (which is more hands-on and custom than we are). Our best explanation for what 2i2c wishes to do is &amp;ldquo;Open source operations/dev-ops as a service&amp;rdquo;, which doesn&amp;rsquo;t quite fit into either category. This means that we have more &amp;ldquo;unknown unknowns&amp;rdquo; about what kind of service and pricing model we should develop. We hope to begin answering some of these questions in our alpha-level service launch. Stay tuned for more to come!&lt;/p>

.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Code for Science &amp;amp; Society is thrilled to welcome the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Interactive Computing Collaboration&lt;/a>
(2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project! After spending a year incubating in the
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">International Computer Science Institute&lt;/a>
, where 2i2c
&lt;a href="https://www.icsi.berkeley.edu/icsi/news/2021/08/2i2c-new-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">received critical startup support&lt;/a>
, 2i2c now joins our fiscally sponsored project program to launch their next phase. 2i2c develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing, with a focus on the Jupyter ecosystem and cloud-native workflows in research and education. They will build a cloud services model that respects a community’s
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Right to Replicate their infrastructure&lt;/a>
by providing transparent and customizable JupyterHub deployments on cloud infrastructure that utilize community-driven open source tools. They aim to use the resources generated from this service in order to support the communities that underlie this infrastructure. Read on for more about 2i2c’s mission and how CS&amp;amp;S will support their team and vision.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c’s organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2c’s co-founders have co-led for many years, including
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Pangeo Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://syzygy.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Syzygy Project&lt;/a>
, the
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Binder Project&lt;/a>
, and the
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/academics/resources/berkeley-data-stack" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UC Berkeley DataHub&lt;/a>
. These projects follow an “integrate, customize, and upstream” model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>CS&amp;amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS&amp;amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS&amp;amp;S’s other initiatives in this space, including CS&amp;amp;S’s other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the
&lt;a href="https://blog.codeforscience.org/cs-s-launches-digital-infrastructure-incubator/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Infrastructure Incubator program&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Achieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2c’s next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2c’s developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.&lt;/p>
