About CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#about-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CILogon&lt;/a>
is an open source service provider that allows users to log in against over 4000 various identity providers, including campus identity providers. The available identity providers are members of
&lt;a href="https://incommon.org/federation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">InCommon&lt;/a>
, a federation of universities and other organizations that provide single sign-on access to various resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cilogon-and-2i2c">
CILogon and 2i2c
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cilogon-and-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For the past year, 2i2c has been successfully using CILogon for more than fifteen of the hubs it manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of the hubs that use it are hubs for communities in education that want to manage their hub access through their own institutional providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With using a tool like CILogon, we allow hub access to be managed both through the communities&amp;rsquo; institutional providers, but also through social providers like GitHub and Google. Because both authentication mechanisms can coexist, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to provide specific credentials for 2i2c staff in order to have access to the hub. This reduces both the burden on institution&amp;rsquo;s IT departments, but also the complexity of a hub deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, as we migrate away from our current Auth0 setup, the number of hubs using CILogon will further increase in the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-setup">
The setup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-setup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The setup that 2i2c uses, is based on two important tools, the CILogon administrative client and the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-cilogon-administrative-client">
The CILogon administrative client
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cilogon-administrative-client">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2i2c administrative client&lt;/a>
provided by CILogon allowed us to automatically manage the CILogon OAuth applications needed for authenticating into the hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For each hub that uses CILogon, we dynamically create an OAuth
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client application&lt;/a>
in CILogon and store the credentials safely, using the script at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/3312f373f0aa59fbc98dc1c8161aa9623b68726b/deployer/cilogon_app.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cilogon_app.py&lt;/a>
. The script can also used for &lt;code>updating&lt;/code> the callback URLs of an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>deleting&lt;/code> a CILogon OAuth application when a hub is removed or changes authentication methods, &lt;code>getting&lt;/code> details about an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>getting all&lt;/code> existing 2i2c CILogon OAuth applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-jupyterhub-cilogonoauthenticator">
The JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-jupyterhub-cilogonoauthenticator">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For CILogon&amp;rsquo;s integration with JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s authentication workflow, we&amp;rsquo;re using the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/blob/main/oauthenticator/cilogon.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;strong>CILogonOAuthenticator&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>
, which is part of the
&lt;a href="https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub OAuthenticator project&lt;/a>
. This is what allows JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers for authentication, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a base for writing other Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this 2i2c integration with the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator some important upstream fixes and enhancements to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&lt;code>oauthenticator&lt;/code>&lt;/a>
were identified and performed. For example, the

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Thanks to the 2i2c - CILogon partnership, during this past year we were able to integrate CILogon into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and to observe its importance, usefulness and great support for 2i2c and the communities we server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are now happy to announce that the 2i2c - CILogon partnership has been expanded to another year!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our goal is to create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service that enables community-based cloud-native workflows in the biosciences. We will promote values of open and inclusive community practices, infrastructure that enables these practices, and a “train the trainers” approach that empowers community leaders to share expertise in cloud infrastructure with others in their communities. Our focus will be on communities in Latin America and Africa, and we hope to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities that are historically marginalized from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will be providing cloud infrastructure operation and support for the communities that we partner with in this effort.
We will also assist with creating content to teach cloud-native workflows and assist community leaders in learning this content so that they can share these skills with others.&lt;/p>

&lt;h1 id="introduction">
Introduction
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mybinder.org&lt;/a>
enables researchers across the world to replicate computational environments in the cloud. It allows researchers to turn static code into interactive literate coding environments with a click of a button within seconds. The
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">mybinder.org&lt;/a>
service is powered by
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub&lt;/a>
, an open-source tool developed by
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Jupyter Project&lt;/a>
that many organizations have deployed for their own communities. It does this by _dynamically building _the software environment needed to reproduce a computation (using a tool called
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
), and making this environment available to users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BinderHub was developed for use-cases that are &lt;em>temporary&lt;/em> and &lt;em>fully open&lt;/em> by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past several years, the
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GESIS Notebooks&lt;/a>
team made the first steps towards bridging this gap through their
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persistent BinderHub&lt;/a>
implementation. This was a modified and authenticated BinderHub that &lt;em>included&lt;/em> persistent storage across sessions. The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NFDI4DS&lt;/a>
,
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CESSDA&lt;/a>
, and members of the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JMTE&lt;/a>
project. This collaboration has three primary goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generalize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure&lt;/strong>, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects&lt;/strong>, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub&lt;/strong>, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See
&lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this GitHub Projects Board for issues that implement this effort&lt;/a>
.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">
Exploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the
&lt;a href="http://binderhub.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>
. We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Persistent BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>
. The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">modified Helm Chart&lt;/a>
that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality &lt;em>natively&lt;/em> into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to take another approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">
Exploration 2: Add dynamic image building to JupyterHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, &lt;strong>we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using
&lt;a href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a>
project that
&lt;a href="https://quantstack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">QuantStack&lt;/a>
had built for the
&lt;a href="https://plasmabio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlasmaBio project&lt;/a>
. This implementation was seen as successful, and something others in the community had wanted to generalize for some time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="our-implementation-plan">
Our implementation plan

&lt;/h1>
&lt;h2 id="two-phases-of-implementation">
Two phases of implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#two-phases-of-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a back-end for dynamic environment building&lt;/strong>. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and is easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are a few tasks that we’re carrying out next to make progress on the above two items.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a working prototype for image generation via a &lt;em>JupyterHub Service&lt;/em> (see below for current status)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research the &lt;code>tljh-repo2docker&lt;/code> code base to understand how we could build upon its UX and functionality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the typical process that GESIS and NFDI users follow in their BinderHub workflows, to ensure that it can be replicated via this new implementation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform UI/UX research validation to inform the implementation from a user’s perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a follow-up, we’ll likely re-work the BinderHub codebase to utilize JupyterHub’s new repo2docker service, rather than defining its own custom repo2docker functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">
Back-end implementation as a JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We’re planning to use
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JupyterHub Services&lt;/a>
to add the back-end functionality for dynamic image building to a JupyterHub. Services are a way to expose functionality via a JupyterHub REST API, and would allow us to expose basic image generation on-the-fly with
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">repo2docker&lt;/a>
. We aim for basic functionality to be as close as possible to repo2docker’s default behavior, but to make this functionality _composable and customizable _if a JupyterHub administrator wants to provide different out-of-the-box functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While details may still change, we believe that the major architectural plan has now been settled. We have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an experimental codebase&lt;/a>
with a basic implementation of the repo2docker service described above. As part of this effort, this team has also made a number of improvements to repo2docker’s codebase and project infrastructure. We hope that this effort will continue to push resources and attention to repo2docker by growing the number of users and stakeholders that rely on the project for their success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">
Front-end implementation that uses this service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once the back-end setup exists, we can use it to begin prototyping user interactions that can trigger and use repo2docker’s image generation. Bringing dynamic environment image building into JupyterHub is a significant improvement in its functionality, and may introduce new kinds of workflows that we hadn’t initially imagined. Understanding, interpreting, and extending the original “Persistent BinderHub” workflow will require a more thorough understanding of user stories and needs in order to identify new workflows that feel natural not only in a JupyterHub scenario but also in a Binder-like scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here are a few major UI/UX questions we must answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When a user builds an image, should it also become available to &lt;em>other users&lt;/em> as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can a user store, find, and delete old images that they’ve built?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about new versions of the same image?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should we simply mimic the mybinder.org UX, or should this be improved as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We must answer these and several other questions next. With that vision in place, we’d like to &lt;strong>expand our efforts in UI/UX and user research&lt;/strong>. This will help inform the technical implementation of this work as we expand on our prototype, and help us choose the right way to expose this functionality to users. We welcome collaboration around this work - if you know of an organization that is interested in collaboration, please reach out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a few months working on this project, we are even more excited about the potential for dynamically building environments in a JupyterHub. We believe that it adds a new class of workflows to JupyterHubs that were not possible before, and will be immediately useful to the hundreds of communities that deploy JupyterHub for their communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open grant narrative: A Collaborative Interactive Computing Service Model for Global Communities</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-global-communities-proposal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-global-communities-proposal/</guid><description>&lt;p>We recently submitted a grant to

Problem statement
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#problem-statement">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cloud infrastructure is a powerful way to broaden access to workflows and infrastructure across the globe.
However, it is also inaccessible to many for a variety of reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a large, diverse, and messy ecosystem of open source tools to facilitate cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most communities don&amp;rsquo;t already have skills in utilizing cloud workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Running infrastructure in the cloud takes dedicated time and expertise that many communities lack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many communities do not have organized communities of practice around cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These issues are true for most scientific communities, but they are exacerbated in countries that are often marginalized in the global scientific community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-proposed-work">
Our proposed work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-proposed-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For this reason, our goal in this grant is to &lt;strong>provide human and technical services to facilitate learning and knowledge transfer of cloud workflows for communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It defines four major areas of collaboration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure management&lt;/strong> - to facilitate access to cloud resources via managed cloud services that integrate open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Application guidance and training&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with the skills to utilize this infrastructure for their needs. This includes language-localized content and training materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Training for trainers&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to share these workflows with others in their communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Community leadership and management&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to sustain and grow healthy communities of practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If this proposal is funded, over the course of two years the team will provide a combination of the services described above for communities in Latin America and Africa, with the goal of understanding how such services can be most useful for these communities, how we can structure them to provide community representation in the direction of these services, and how we can sustain and scale this model of community-focused services for a global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Importantly, we wish to do this work in a way that centers the communities we work with as co-leaders and collaborators in these services.
We will explore ways to run these services and workshops so that they are transparent, inclusive, and give agency to the communities they support.
Ultimately, we hope that this can be an extensible model for many more communities in the future.&lt;/p>
