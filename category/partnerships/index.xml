&lt;h2 id="what-happened">
What happened?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, the JupyterHub team discovered a security vulnerability in
// This is a custom link resolver that resolves both internal and external links, thanks to @cmd-ntrf for the helpful fix.
&lt;a href="https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> package&lt;/a>
that would allow potential unauthenticated access to a JupyterHub via WebSockets, allowing unauthenticated users to run arbitrary code on the JupyterHub.
&lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> is used by many communities to provide alternative user interfaces like RStudio and remote desktops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This vulnerability was detected by the JupyterHub team, with leadership from 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers. It was resolved through upstream contributions to the JupyterHub project, and we have deployed a fix that mitigates this vulnerability for all the hubs 2i2c manages.&lt;/p>

Does this impact my 2i2c community hub?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-this-impact-my-2i2c-community-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We do not believe that any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities were impacted by this vulnerability, and
// This is a custom link resolver that resolves both internal and external links, thanks to @cmd-ntrf for the helpful fix.

has now been pushed to all community hubs to resolve this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your community was vulnerable to this problem, you might experience slightly slower startup latency while we work out a long-term solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is a vulnerability in the docker image used by our communities, we will be reaching out over the next few weeks to put a more permanent fix in place.&lt;/p>

Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re grateful that the JupyterHub community was quick to acknowledge, respond, and resolve this security vulnerability after it was brought to their attention.
We&amp;rsquo;re also proud that 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers helped the JupyterHub team throughout the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allowed our team to resolve the problem before it impacted any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities.
Because 2i2c community infrastructure is managed in a central location, we were able to resolve this for over 80 communities with a single team rather than expecting each community to learn about and fix this problem on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also believe this reflects the healthy upstream relationships that we hope to encourage with our team&amp;rsquo;s

&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Open Source strategy and practices&lt;/a>
.
By working with the JupyterHub community and pushing changes upstream, we&amp;rsquo;ve resolved this issue for &lt;em>any&lt;/em> user of &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code>, not just 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s own ecosystem.
In particular, because of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s position running hubs for many communities via Kubernetes, we were able to identify a solution that did not require every user image to be updated (as described in section &lt;strong>For JupyterHub admins of Z2JH installations&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe that all of these lead to a healthier, safer ecosystem of open source tools ❤️.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integrating BinderHub with JupyterHub: Empowering users to manage their own environments</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 16:56:14 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Thanks to

BinderHubs often do not have persistent storage nor persistent user identity, and UX is centered around &lt;em>ephemeral&lt;/em> interactivity that can be shared with others (via a link), rather than &lt;em>persistent&lt;/em> interactivity that a single user repeatedly comes back to.

, aims to bring this flexibility to JupyterHub directly. We aim to empower users to decide for themselves which applications and dependencies are installed on a per-project basis. Our work enables communities with heterogeneous requirements to share a single Hub. Our approach frees administrators from being overwhelmed by installation requests and transforms the JupyterHub platform into a platform for collaborative computational reproducibility. In this update, we report on our progress and upcoming steps in this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">
What does a BinderHub do, exactly?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is helpful to understand that BinderHub primarily has 3 responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Present a UI to the end user for them to provide details on what to build (this is what you see when you go to mybinder.org)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call out to
// This is a custom link resolver that resolves both internal and external links, thanks to @cmd-ntrf for the helpful fix.
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>
in a scalable way to actually &lt;em>build and push&lt;/em> an image containing the environment for the given repository, and show the user logs as this build process happens. This also allows users to debug issues with their build more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk to a JupyterHub instance to launch a user server with the built docker image, and redirect the user to this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>(2) is really the &lt;em>core&lt;/em> feature of BinderHub, and we settled on figuring out how to make that available to JupyterHub users. It was really important to us that this was also done in a way that can be sustainably used by &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em>, not just 2i2c. This blog post discusses the various improvements to the broad ecosystem of projects in the Jupyter ecosystem to get this done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demo">
Demo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#demo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But first, a very quick demo of how this looks like right now now!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- generated from original .mov screen recording with `ffmpeg -i screencast.mov -c:v libx264 screencast.mp4` -->
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./screencast.mp4" autoplay muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very much a work in progress, but the basic flow can be seen clearly. Users see a Server Options menu after they log into JupyterHub. They can specify the two primary things that determine the server configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The resources allocated (RAM, CPU and maybe GPU)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The environment (container image) used, which can be specified in one of 3 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. A pre-selected list of environments (container images), provided by the administrators who set up this JupyterHub
b. A blank text box where you can enter any publicly available docker image they want
c. A mybinder.org style way to specify a GitHub repository, which will be then dynamically built into a docker image for the user!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what did we need to do to accomplish this, in a way that&amp;rsquo;s very upstream friendly and usable by everyone (and not just 2i2c)?&lt;/p>

&lt;em>includes&lt;/em> a JupyterHub as a dependency, and configures itself to be used primarily in a manner similar to
// This is a custom link resolver that resolves both internal and external links, thanks to @cmd-ntrf for the helpful fix.
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a>
. As the person who helped make that choice early on, I can tell you why it was made - for convenience! And it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> very convenient, as it allowed us to get mybinder.org going fast. However, it makes it difficult to install a BinderHub service &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub. To this end, we have created a standalone

, designed to be installed &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub, so we can use it &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> to build images. This allows the BinderHub instance to be used as a

&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Service&lt;/a>
, which is what we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this helm chart is currently under the 2i2c GitHub org, the hope is that it can eventually migrate to a

organization (once it is created), or it can become the upstream helm chart for BinderHub if enough work can be done in BinderHub to allow it to serve use cases like mybinder.org.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this work, we also added a way for BinderHub to run in

&lt;a href="" >three responsibilities of BinderHub&lt;/a>
we discussed previously, allowing us to bring our own UI and JupyterHub. BinderHub could now be used &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> for its scalable image building features, which is exactly what we want!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">
Sustainably extending KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We identified KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> feature as the ideal location for UI to dynamically build environments (container images), making it just another &amp;rsquo;environment choice&amp;rsquo; people can choose, along with picking the resources their server needs. From an end-user perspective, it was also the logical place for them to specify a repository to build into an environment, as they could already choose some pre-built environments from here. They can also select other arbitrary resources they want (such as memory, GPU, etc) from here as well. From a maintainer perspective, it helps with long-term maintenance of the JupyterHub projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation of &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> however, was not easy to extend at this point. So

improved how easy it was to extend it in more complex ways, without making the implementation in KubeSpawner itself complicated. Even though this had &lt;em>no&lt;/em> visible end-user effects, it was an extremely important step in allowing us to experiment with UI in a &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> way without having to rely on upstream. These kinds of changes can sometimes be hard to sell to stakeholders but are extremely important in ensuring a continuous and sustainable relationship with upstream.&lt;/p>

Implementing &lt;code>unlisted_choice&lt;/code> feature in KubeSpawner
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The profileList feature was built to allow JupyterHub &lt;em>admins&lt;/em> to specify an explicit list of container images the end-user can choose from. It did not have a way for any choice that was &lt;em>not&lt;/em> pre-approved by the admin to be used. We needed this feature since the BinderHub API will build a new docker image for each environment the user wants, and so this can not be chosen from a pre-approved list. We had to safely add this feature to KubeSpawner in such a way that it was generally useful to everyone. Many other communities had been asking for such a feature anyway - the ability to simply &amp;rsquo;type in&amp;rsquo; an image and have that be used.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key component of doing &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> upstream work is that every addition needs to be useful by itself for a broad group of people. This change was very helpful for many communities that wanted to allow their users the freedom to pick whatever image they want to use, regardless of wether they wanted to use dynamic image building or not. The broad interest allowed us to build a coalition with other interested parties, and get the change accepted upstream more easily!&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once we had all these pieces in place, it was time to actually work on the frontend UI that would allow users to build images dynamically and launch them. Since this will replace the &amp;lsquo;profileList&amp;rsquo; feature, it should also allow them to select different resources (RAM, CPU, etc) as needed, as well as type in an existing image if they desire. So it was a full re-implementation of the &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> frontend.&lt;/p>

Because the default profileList implementation is pure HTML / CSS with very &lt;em>minimal&lt;/em> JS, it is limited in what kind of UX it could have. &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> aims to be very helpful &lt;em>even&lt;/em> when dynamic image-building features are not enabled on a JupyterHub. We hope to roll this out to a few JupyterHubs and improve it over time based on feedback.&lt;/p>

and mybinder.org, the primary public BinderHub installation. mybinder.org has some extra protections against cryptojacking that aren&amp;rsquo;t easily usable elsewhere, and this has unfortunately meant that the demo JupyterHubs we have with these features enabled have been behind a login wall. I personally believe login walls are long term antithetical to open science, and so this was an important problem to solve.&lt;/p>

CILogon and 2i2c
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cilogon-and-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For the past year, 2i2c has been successfully using CILogon for more than fifteen of the hubs it manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of the hubs that use it are hubs for communities in education that want to manage their hub access through their own institutional providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With using a tool like CILogon, we allow hub access to be managed both through the communities&amp;rsquo; institutional providers, but also through social providers like GitHub and Google. Because both authentication mechanisms can coexist, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to provide specific credentials for 2i2c staff in order to have access to the hub. This reduces both the burden on institution&amp;rsquo;s IT departments, but also the complexity of a hub deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, as we migrate away from our current Auth0 setup, the number of hubs using CILogon will further increase in the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-setup">
The setup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-setup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The setup that 2i2c uses, is based on two important tools, the CILogon administrative client and the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator.&lt;/p>

. The script can also used for &lt;code>updating&lt;/code> the callback URLs of an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>deleting&lt;/code> a CILogon OAuth application when a hub is removed or changes authentication methods, &lt;code>getting&lt;/code> details about an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>getting all&lt;/code> existing 2i2c CILogon OAuth applications.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our goal is to create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service that enables community-based cloud-native workflows in the biosciences. We will promote values of open and inclusive community practices, infrastructure that enables these practices, and a “train the trainers” approach that empowers community leaders to share expertise in cloud infrastructure with others in their communities. Our focus will be on communities in Latin America and Africa, and we hope to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities that are historically marginalized from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will be providing cloud infrastructure operation and support for the communities that we partner with in this effort.
We will also assist with creating content to teach cloud-native workflows and assist community leaders in learning this content so that they can share these skills with others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>BinderHub was developed for use-cases that are &lt;em>temporary&lt;/em> and &lt;em>fully open&lt;/em> by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.&lt;/p>

The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with

&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generalize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure&lt;/strong>, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects&lt;/strong>, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub&lt;/strong>, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See

Exploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the

&lt;a href="http://binderhub.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>
. We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the

. The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a

that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality &lt;em>natively&lt;/em> into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to take another approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">
Exploration 2: Add dynamic image building to JupyterHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, &lt;strong>we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using

&lt;a href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>
&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the

&lt;h2 id="two-phases-of-implementation">
Two phases of implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#two-phases-of-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a back-end for dynamic environment building&lt;/strong>. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and is easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are a few tasks that we’re carrying out next to make progress on the above two items.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a working prototype for image generation via a &lt;em>JupyterHub Service&lt;/em> (see below for current status)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research the &lt;code>tljh-repo2docker&lt;/code> code base to understand how we could build upon its UX and functionality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the typical process that GESIS and NFDI users follow in their BinderHub workflows, to ensure that it can be replicated via this new implementation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform UI/UX research validation to inform the implementation from a user’s perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a follow-up, we’ll likely re-work the BinderHub codebase to utilize JupyterHub’s new repo2docker service, rather than defining its own custom repo2docker functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">
Back-end implementation as a JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We’re planning to use

&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Services&lt;/a>
to add the back-end functionality for dynamic image building to a JupyterHub. Services are a way to expose functionality via a JupyterHub REST API, and would allow us to expose basic image generation on-the-fly with
// This is a custom link resolver that resolves both internal and external links, thanks to @cmd-ntrf for the helpful fix.
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>
. We aim for basic functionality to be as close as possible to repo2docker’s default behavior, but to make this functionality _composable and customizable _if a JupyterHub administrator wants to provide different out-of-the-box functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While details may still change, we believe that the major architectural plan has now been settled. We have

&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an experimental codebase&lt;/a>
with a basic implementation of the repo2docker service described above. As part of this effort, this team has also made a number of improvements to repo2docker’s codebase and project infrastructure. We hope that this effort will continue to push resources and attention to repo2docker by growing the number of users and stakeholders that rely on the project for their success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">
Front-end implementation that uses this service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once the back-end setup exists, we can use it to begin prototyping user interactions that can trigger and use repo2docker’s image generation. Bringing dynamic environment image building into JupyterHub is a significant improvement in its functionality, and may introduce new kinds of workflows that we hadn’t initially imagined. Understanding, interpreting, and extending the original “Persistent BinderHub” workflow will require a more thorough understanding of user stories and needs in order to identify new workflows that feel natural not only in a JupyterHub scenario but also in a Binder-like scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here are a few major UI/UX questions we must answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When a user builds an image, should it also become available to &lt;em>other users&lt;/em> as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can a user store, find, and delete old images that they’ve built?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about new versions of the same image?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should we simply mimic the mybinder.org UX, or should this be improved as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We must answer these and several other questions next. With that vision in place, we’d like to &lt;strong>expand our efforts in UI/UX and user research&lt;/strong>. This will help inform the technical implementation of this work as we expand on our prototype, and help us choose the right way to expose this functionality to users.

&lt;p>After a few months working on this project, we are even more excited about the potential for dynamically building environments in a JupyterHub. We believe that it adds a new class of workflows to JupyterHubs that were not possible before, and will be immediately useful to the hundreds of communities that deploy JupyterHub for their communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Open grant narrative: A Collaborative Interactive Computing Service Model for Global Communities</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-global-communities-proposal/</link><pubDate>Sun, 28 Aug 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-global-communities-proposal/</guid><description>&lt;p>We recently submitted a grant to

Problem statement
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#problem-statement">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cloud infrastructure is a powerful way to broaden access to workflows and infrastructure across the globe.
However, it is also inaccessible to many for a variety of reasons:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>There is a large, diverse, and messy ecosystem of open source tools to facilitate cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Most communities don&amp;rsquo;t already have skills in utilizing cloud workflows.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Running infrastructure in the cloud takes dedicated time and expertise that many communities lack.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Many communities do not have organized communities of practice around cloud infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These issues are true for most scientific communities, but they are exacerbated in countries that are often marginalized in the global scientific community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-proposed-work">
Our proposed work
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-proposed-work">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For this reason, our goal in this grant is to &lt;strong>provide human and technical services to facilitate learning and knowledge transfer of cloud workflows for communities in Latin America and Africa&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It defines four major areas of collaboration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cloud infrastructure management&lt;/strong> - to facilitate access to cloud resources via managed cloud services that integrate open source tools.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Application guidance and training&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with the skills to utilize this infrastructure for their needs. This includes language-localized content and training materials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Training for trainers&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to share these workflows with others in their communities.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Community leadership and management&lt;/strong> - to provide community leaders with skills to sustain and grow healthy communities of practice.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>If this proposal is funded, over the course of two years the team will provide a combination of the services described above for communities in Latin America and Africa, with the goal of understanding how such services can be most useful for these communities, how we can structure them to provide community representation in the direction of these services, and how we can sustain and scale this model of community-focused services for a global community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Importantly, we wish to do this work in a way that centers the communities we work with as co-leaders and collaborators in these services.
We will explore ways to run these services and workshops so that they are transparent, inclusive, and give agency to the communities they support.
Ultimately, we hope that this can be an extensible model for many more communities in the future.&lt;/p>
