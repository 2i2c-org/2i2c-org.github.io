That&amp;rsquo;s probably because the PR is from a forked repository! Here&amp;rsquo;s a little learning we had after losing a bunch of time figuring this out:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="our-pr-from-a-fork-was-using-empty-strings-for-repository-secrets">
Our PR from a fork was using empty strings for repository secrets
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#our-pr-from-a-fork-was-using-empty-strings-for-repository-secrets">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/github-activity" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>github-activity&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is a tool we help maintain for
&lt;a href="https://github-activity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#how-we-define-contributors-in-the-reports" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >generating changelogs from a wider variety of contributions&lt;/a> than GitHub&amp;rsquo;s defaults. We needed to set a secret to raise the API rate limits for the tool&amp;rsquo;s tests. These tests pull data from repositories outside of the &lt;code>github-activity&lt;/code> repository itself, which quickly hit GitHub&amp;rsquo;s rate limits without authentication.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The problem seemed straightforward at first: we added the secret, but the workflow was acting as if the secret didn&amp;rsquo;t exist at all. After updating the code to explicitly check for empty strings, we discovered the authentication token was actually &lt;em>an empty string&lt;/em>, even though it had been set.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After some debugging, we uncovered the root cause: &lt;strong>the PR was opened from a fork of &lt;code>github-activity&lt;/code>&lt;/strong>. GitHub intentionally
&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/write-workflows/choose-what-workflows-do/use-secrets" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >makes secrets appear as empty strings when a PR originates from a forked repository&lt;/a>. This is a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive credentials.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-quick-fix-re-open-the-pr-from-the-base-repository">
A quick fix: re-open the PR from the base repository
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-quick-fix-re-open-the-pr-from-the-base-repository">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The immediate fix was simple: re-open the PR from a branch in the base repository rather than from the fork. This worked perfectly, but it&amp;rsquo;s not a sustainable solution for open source projects that rely on community contributions from forks.
We don&amp;rsquo;t want to create a dynamic where maintainers have different PR workflows because they&amp;rsquo;re operating on the base repository.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="how-use-secrets-with-forked-repositories-in-a-safe-ish-way">
How use secrets with forked repositories in a safe-ish way
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-use-secrets-with-forked-repositories-in-a-safe-ish-way">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If you need to make secrets available to PRs from forks, there are a few approaches we learned about, each with security trade-offs:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-pull_request_target-workflow">
The &lt;code>pull_request_target&lt;/code> workflow
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pull_request_target-workflow">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>GitHub provides a
&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/enabling-features-for-your-repository/managing-github-actions-settings-for-a-repository#controlling-changes-from-forks-to-workflows-in-public-repositories" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>pull_request_target&lt;/code> workflow&lt;/a> that can access secrets even when triggered by forked PRs. In this case, GitHub will &lt;strong>always run the test suite on &lt;code>main&lt;/code>&lt;/strong>, instead of any changes your PR introduces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Why this is dangerous&lt;/strong>: malicious actors could add &lt;em>code&lt;/em> to a PR that exfiltrates your secrets (for example, Python code that prints &lt;code>os.environ[&amp;quot;MY_SECRET&amp;quot;]&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As a result, &lt;strong>only use secrets that you&amp;rsquo;re OK with being public&lt;/strong>. In this case, we generated a read-only token with restricted permissions. However, this is still kinda risky so use at your own peril.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your repository workflows &lt;em>require&lt;/em> a secret that &lt;em>absolutely cannot be public&lt;/em> (e.g., a publishing key for a package repository), try a method like the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="using-github-environments-for-granular-control">
Using GitHub Environments for granular control
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#using-github-environments-for-granular-control">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>A safer approach is to use
&lt;a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/deploy/configure-and-manage-deployments/manage-environments" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GitHub Environments&lt;/a>, which let you restrict which secrets are available to specific jobs. This way, you can ensure that only non-critical secrets (like those needed for testing) are available to jobs that run on forked PRs, while keeping sensitive secrets (like PyPI publishing tokens) restricted to trusted contexts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is the approach we implemented in &lt;code>github-activity&lt;/code>, and it provides a good balance between security and community contribution workflows. We created a separate environment for publishing to PyPI so that its secret is never available to the job that runs with &lt;code>pull_request_target&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="we-hope-this-saves-you-time">
We hope this saves you time!
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#we-hope-this-saves-you-time">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Hopefully this learning is useful to others who run into the same confusing behavior. We&amp;rsquo;ve added a few improvements to &lt;code>github-activity&lt;/code> to more reliably check for empty strings to surface this kind of condition, but knowing the basic behavior of GitHub environments and forked PRs is even better.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="" >Yuvi Panda&lt;/a> recently gave a talk at the
&lt;a href="https://meetup.doepy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >doepy meetup&lt;/a> about JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s interest in moving beyond the &amp;ldquo;single-user notebook application&amp;rdquo; and towards a more flexible approach to enabling administrators to deploy many different types of applications and environments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out a video of the talk here:&lt;/p>

However, it&amp;rsquo;s one of those things that often gets de-prioritized with all of the other work that needs to happen in a project.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are heavy users of the
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker project&lt;/a> in 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s service. It allows you to dynamically build an environment image that can by hosted in a cloud service like JupyterHub. It&amp;rsquo;s the underlying tool used by
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a>, and is the focus of recent work on enabling
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/q1-product-goals/" >dynamic image building in a JupyterHub&lt;/a> (more on that to come).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this work, we decided to do a small
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker/pull/1433" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >overhaul of repo2docker&amp;rsquo;s documentation&lt;/a>, with the goal of making it easier to discover, navigate, and learn from. Here&amp;rsquo;s how the landing page looks now!&lt;/p>

JupyterHub: A multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-a-multi-user-server-for-jupyter-notebooks">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This is how JupyterHub was described when it was announced in 2015, 10 years ago. The focus was on bringing Jupyter Notebooks to multiple users on shared infrastructure. The Jupyter Notebooks focus was so strong that Jupyter was even in the name of the project! Fast forward 10 years, &amp;amp; this is still the most common perception of JupyterHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this has not been true for a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> time now. Instead of setting up 5 different kinds of infrastructure to support your users based on what kind of &lt;em>interface&lt;/em> they like to use (
&lt;a href="https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterLab&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >RStudio&lt;/a>, Linux Desktop tools like
&lt;a href="https://qgis.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGIS&lt;/a> or

&lt;a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Visual Studio Code&lt;/a>, full &lt;code>ssh&lt;/code> (!?), etc) for their interactive computing, you can set up a JupyterHub that supports all of those! Meet your users where they are, rather than force them to conform to using only a specific set of tools.&lt;/p>

Cloudy with a Chance of Savings: Per-User Usage and Cost Monitoring for JupyterHubs in the Cloud
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cloudy-with-a-chance-of-savings-per-user-usage-and-cost-monitoring-for-jupyterhubs-in-the-cloud">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Cloud cost monitoring is moving beyond just preventing runaway cost explosions – it&amp;rsquo;s about empowering JupyterHub administrators with the guardrails they need to run efficient, transparent, and sustainable infrastructures. A cloud cost bill can show a broad view of services and machines provisioned, but how can we provide granular insights into each user and the value they are deriving from the hub on an application level?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve developed several open-source components towards answering this question:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Metric Collection&lt;/strong> –
&lt;a href="https://prometheus.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Prometheus&lt;/a> collects resource usage metrics (including CPU, memory, and storage) from individual user pods via standard and custom exporters.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Cost Estimation&lt;/strong> – Usage is correlated with AWS cost data to estimate per-user costs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Visualization&lt;/strong> –
&lt;a href="https://grafana.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Grafana&lt;/a> dashboards display rich, interactive views of usage and cost data, making it easy to monitor trends, identify high-cost workloads, and generate reports for funders and decision-makers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>This approach delivers cloud observability and cost transparency that can be reliably deployed using
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kubernetes&lt;/a> and integrated with
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Zero to JupyterHub&lt;/a> distributions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="controlling-home-directory-costs-with-user-empathy-on-the-cloud-with-jupyterhub-home-nfs">

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>User home directories on JupyterHubs deployed in cloud providers has been a pain point for both end users and administrators. Administrators feel the pain of cloud costs for home directory storage (sometimes higher than compute!). No user wants to receive an email saying &amp;ldquo;well, this code you copy pasted downloaded 3TB of netcdf files into your home directory, and now we have used up our entire team&amp;rsquo;s cloud budget for the next 2 years&amp;rdquo; (true story).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-home-nfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/a> open source project is a JupyterHub native, cloud agnostic solution to these problems. Administrators can do per user limits, tune performance, report on usage and make cloud cost conscious choices around overprovisioning. It provides users empathetic guardrails to prevent them from overuse, rather than punitive gates that zap them after the fact.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this short talk, we will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Describe the core of the problem, and how it manifests for users and admins.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Review current solutions and their limitations&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Introduce jupyterhub-home-nfs and how it moves the solution space forward&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Demo how this looks like for an end user&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk about future direction, and opportunities for collaboration&lt;/li>

&lt;p>JupyterHub: A multi-user server for Jupyter notebooks&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is how JupyterHub was described when it was announced in 2015, 10 years ago. The focus was on bringing Jupyter Notebooks to multiple users on shared infrastructure. The Jupyter Notebooks focus was so strong that Jupyter was even in the name of the project! Fast forward 10 years, &amp;amp; this is still the most common perception of JupyterHub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this has not been true for a &lt;em>long&lt;/em> time now. Instead of setting up 5 different kinds of infrastructure to support your users based on what kind of &lt;em>interface&lt;/em> they like to use (

Meet your users where they are, rather than force them to conform to using only a specific set of tools.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Open source communities can be incredible and irreplaceable sources of human connection in our lives, offering a unique kind of fulfillment hard to find elsewhere. This feeling of fulfillment and approval can, for some people, be a soothing balm in an otherwise rough life. However, it has the be part of a healthy, balanced ecosystem of different kinds of connections offering different kinds of fulfillment . If a significant chunk of fulfillment in your life comes from the open source work you do, unbalanced by other sources, that can quickly become unhealthy for both you and the community. Disagreements are more likely to become high stakes. Interactions can quickly become emotionally charged and filled with hard to interpret subtext. This can both burn you out, and drive away potential new community members.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk explores the why &lt;em>emotional regulation&lt;/em> is a critical skill for participating in open source communities, and how therapy can be a tool for learning that skill. Come to learn:&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c is a non-profit organization that fosters co-creation and collaboration between science communities and open source communities. We are deeply embedded in an international network of research and education communities, as well as open source communities that underlie their infrastructure (particularly in the Jupyter ecosystem). Our technical infrastructure is built entirely with open source components that we contribute to, but do not control. This is a really hard problem to solve!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot in the first four years of our existence. This talk will describe how our organization approaches a healthy and productive open source relationship with the Jupyter (and broader scientific python) ecosystem. It&amp;rsquo;ll cover some of the major mistakes we&amp;rsquo;ve made, lessons learned, and where we think we&amp;rsquo;ve had impact. We aim to make this talk full of practical learnings that others can follow in building sustainable open science organizations that contribute to a healthy and vibrant open source ecosystem. Our goal will be to provide inspiration to others that are interested in building on top of open source projects like Jupyter, and want to do so in a way that is healthy and sustainable.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Jupyter Book at the Scientific Python 2025 Developer Summit</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/scientific-python-summit/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/scientific-python-summit/</guid><description>&lt;p>Chris and Angus recently attended the Scientific Python 2025 Developer Summit on behalf of

&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is a massive public service for creating and sharing reproducible computational environments. It is managed by the JupyterHub team and
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/federation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >members of the &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> federation&lt;/a>. One challenge in running
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is identifying cloud credits or financial resources to support the cloud infrastructure that runs the service. Two years ago,
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/jupyter-blog/mybinder-org-reducing-capacity-c93ccfc6413f" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Google stopped supporting &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> federation with cloud credits&lt;/a>, and last month
&lt;a href="https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/mybinder-org-reduced-capacity-stability/31750" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the federation lost more capacity&lt;/a>, leaving only
&lt;a href="https://www.gesis.org/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GESIS&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://us.ovhcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OVH&lt;/a> as remaining federation members&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. This makes &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> less reliable, slower, and generally less useful to the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The landscape of cloud infrastructure technology and services has changed considerably, and we think that there&amp;rsquo;s a way to deploy BinderHub instances with lower costs and less complexity. We&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished this by deploying a &lt;strong>single-node Kubernetes cluster&lt;/strong> on a VM provider that is much cheaper, now running at &lt;code>2i2c.mybinder.org&lt;/code>. This both relieves Binder&amp;rsquo;s short-term capacity shortage and may provide an easier pathway for others to support the project in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below, we&amp;rsquo;ll describe what has changed to enable this, what we&amp;rsquo;re deploying, and what the impact should be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-infrastructure-has-become-cheaper-and-more-commodified">
Cloud infrastructure has become cheaper and more commodified
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-infrastructure-has-become-cheaper-and-more-commodified">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A key theory of mybinder.org (and 2i2c) is that commercial cloud infrastructure will be commidified over time &amp;ndash; what begins as cutting-edge functionality will become commonplace and offered across all cloud providers. As a result, costs will go down over time. Abstractions like
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kubernetes&lt;/a> will allow you to easily migrate workflows and infrastructure between cloud providers. As a result, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to easily &lt;em>follow those costs&lt;/em> where there are better options. That&amp;rsquo;s essentially what is happening here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two key changes that make it much easier to deploy a BinderHub instance at a fraction of the cost:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, &lt;strong>Kubernetes has matured and become easier to deploy&lt;/strong>. When mybinder.org started, it was using the cutting-edge of Kubernetes functionality. This meant that we needed to use cloud providers that provided a &lt;em>managed Kubernetes service&lt;/em> to deal with this complexity. A managed Kubernetes offering tends to be expensive, offered by only a few cloud providers, and thus raises costs across-the-board for the provider that offers it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this was almost a decade ago, and Kubernetes has become both more functional and more stable. There are now many more ways of running Kubernetes, especially for simpler workflows that don&amp;rsquo;t require autoscaling. In the last several months, we&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with &lt;strong>single-node Kubernetes workflows&lt;/strong> via
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a> is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that is much easier to deploy and manage. It&amp;rsquo;s designed for things like edge computing and low-resource environments, and it can be deployed with a single script!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By running a Kubernetes cluster on a single node, we don&amp;rsquo;t need a &amp;ldquo;managed Kubernetes service&amp;rdquo;, which means &lt;strong>we can choose from a much larger pool of infrastructure / cloud providers&lt;/strong>. If all we need is a running VM, this is something the tech industry has been doing for decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, &lt;strong>Managed Object Storage services have more open source options, and are more commodified and cheaper&lt;/strong>. In addition to Kubernetes, the other thing that BinderHub needs is a way to store and retrieve images for the environments that it builds. This also used to be a fairly complex problem, and thus required managed solutions from cloud providers that charged a premium for their service. However, a number of open source object storage solutions have emerged and made it much easier for providers to support this workflow.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Because these are open source, infrastructure providers can provide managed object storage at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of these two things, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that we can run a BinderHub instance on a single VM from a much larger pool of infrastructure providers. This means &lt;strong>we should be able to run BinderHub instances at a fraction of the cost&lt;/strong>.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>

Deploying BinderHub on a single-node VM is cheaper and simpler
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#deploying-binderhub-on-a-single-node-vm-is-cheaper-and-simpler">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Last week, we
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/3169" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >deployed 2i2c.mybinder.org&lt;/a>, a single-node Kubernetes instance on
&lt;a href="https://hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hetzner&lt;/a> cloud using
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a>. This will run on a single node VM, with a Kubernetes instance that is entirely managed by us, and with managed object storage from Hetzner. Compared to other cloud providers, it is &lt;strong>around 5x cheaper per month&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Running a single-node Kubernetes instance will be a cheap and effective way to handle a lot of &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo;s capacity needs. Because it&amp;rsquo;s a single node cluster, there is no auto-scaling (one reason it is so cheap), which reduces a lot of the complexity we&amp;rsquo;ll have to manage. These are acceptable tradeoffs for a service like &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>, which runs entirely ephemeral sessions with very limited resources and no promises about uptime, persistence, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be wondering: &amp;ldquo;I thought Kubernetes was supposed to &lt;em>save money&lt;/em>.&amp;rdquo; Normally, running Kubernetes for scalable workflows does save costs because you can scale infrastructure to match your capacity needs. Without scaling, you&amp;rsquo;d need to provide a VM that can &lt;em>always&lt;/em> handle your &lt;em>maximum capacity&lt;/em> needs (and pay for the costs the entire time). With Kubernetes, you can request and remove nodes to grow your capacity as-needed (and save money doing so). It looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-the-cost-difference-between-a-single-large-vm-vs-scalable-nodes-given-variable-usage-over-time-kubernetes-allows-you-to-scale-your-cost-up-and-down-with-need-which-is-more-efficient-than-paying-for-a-single-vm-that-can-withstand-your-maximum-capacity">

The cost difference between a single large VM vs scalable nodes. Given variable usage over time, kubernetes allows you to scale your cost up and down with need, which is more efficient than paying for a single VM that can withstand your maximum capacity.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>However, there is a built-in cost you pay when you use a service that provides managed Kubernetes. &lt;strong>Managed Kubernetes services are complex and expensive&lt;/strong>, and this is reflected across-the-board in the provider&amp;rsquo;s costs. What if we could achieve the same outcome with a much simpler cloud offering like a single VM?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did a bit of research and discovered that the Kubernetes and object storage landscape has indeed evolved significantly since the early days of mybinder.org. For example,
&lt;a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hetzner&lt;/a> is a cloud provider that has been around for a long time. It has single-node VMs that are about &lt;code>4x&lt;/code> cheaper than their counterparts in Google Cloud or AWS, and provides managed object storage that uses
&lt;a href="https://min.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MinIO&lt;/a> in a cost-effective way. Using
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a>, we can run a lightweight, single-node Kubernetes runtime on this node, and deploy a BinderHub with the same infrastructure as any other BinderHub federation member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By our estimate, we could fit around &lt;strong>400 simultaneous sessions&lt;/strong> on &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> (because each session uses very few cloud resources). This is already the majority of mybinder.org&amp;rsquo;s capacity needs, and at a much lower cost than using a scalable Kubernetes cluster. The cost picture looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-if-your-single-vm-is-much-cheaper-it-might-still-be-the-cheapest-option-in-the-case-of-a-hetzner-vm-it-has-roughly-the-same-capacity-as-another-cloud-providers-vm-but-at-14-of-the-cost">

&lt;p>For now, 2i2c is sponsoring a max of €350 a month (with some currency conversion noise) to run this service. We&amp;rsquo;ll provide in-kind labor to run this node, and treat it as an organizational investment in supporting open science, as well as learning new Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure workflows. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use funds recovered from communities in our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/platform/" >community hub network&lt;/a>, along with in-kind labor to build out this experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In six months, we&amp;rsquo;ll evaluate how much effort it was to run this node for &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>, whether it meaningfully helped with &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo;s capacity, and whether it was sustainable for us from a time and labor perspective.&lt;/p>

While this usually isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal, it means that there is a missed opportunity to grow the impact of an ecosystem because it requires coordinated development among multiple stakeholders within it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of the reasons we created 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s open community hub platform. By deploying a single platform that utilizes entirely open infrastructure that we contribute back to, we have visibility over a variety of projects along with the need to combine them together for a specific end-user outcome. One-such development scenario recently came up involving
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Allowing readers to &amp;ldquo;bring their own Binders&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#allowing-readers-to-bring-their-own-binders">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working to integrate
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> workflows with our community hubs for a more seamless experience (for example, having book pages link back to interactive cloud sessions that allow users to interact with the content). We imagine a network of Jupyter Books that all build upon the same core infrastructures (JupyterHub, Binder, etc) for cloud-based computing. Our hope is to allow a user to &lt;em>bring their own Binder&lt;/em> with them so that they can interact with another book&amp;rsquo;s content with their own cloud infrastructure. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A student with access to &lt;code>binder.myuniversity.edu&lt;/code> could read a Jupyter Book created by a professor at &lt;code>otheruniversity.edu&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Jupyter Book is defined with a
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder specification&lt;/a> that has a recipe for re-building the environment needed to run te book&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the professor&amp;rsquo;s book, the student can choose to launch an interactive Binder sessions on &lt;em>their university&amp;rsquo;s Binder&lt;/em>, allowing them to interact with the book&amp;rsquo;s content on their own infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We want a workflow like this to be as seamless and un-complicated as possible. We also want it to follow the same fundamental workflow as the
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/community/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller-based launch buttons&lt;/a>. Along the way, we realized that we needed to coordinate development across
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>, and

Getting Jupyter Book to discover Jupyter Hub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-jupyter-book-to-discover-jupyter-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As we began developing this workflow, we realized that there was a blocker in the JupyterHub and BinderHub ecosystem that needed to be fixed. We needed a way to &lt;strong>ask a JupyterHub whether it had an unauthenticated end-point for service discovery&lt;/strong>. Basically, a way to ask a hub &amp;ldquo;what kind of hub are you, and how can we launch an interactive session on you?&amp;rdquo; Doing this is simple-enough - JupyterHub already has a way of reporting its version and application type, which allows us to infer how to launch interactive sessions. But, we hit a snag in an HTML context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, JupyterHub disallows certain kinds of
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&lt;/a> (CORS) requests, in order to restrict other applications from abusing a JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API. If you hit parts of a JupyterHub API from &lt;em>the command line&lt;/em>, things work fine. But if you do the same thing via JavaScript from a website, the request is disallowed. This was a problem if we want Jupyter Book (a web application) to be able to make requests of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we realized that we needed to make an &lt;strong>upstream contribution in JupyterHub&lt;/strong> in order to &lt;strong>enable an interaction between JupyterHub and Jupyter Book&lt;/strong>. In this case, it was a relatively simple fix: allowing CORS requests for the specific API endpoint we needed (which is a very lightweight endpoint that is not vulnerable to security risks, and is broadly useful to make accessible)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. That resulted in two PRs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4966" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/jupyterhub#4966&lt;/a> allows CORS requests for the API that was needed for service discovery in JupyterHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/binderhub#1906&lt;/a> enables this workflow on a BinderHub so that its services can be discovered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/pull/503" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyter-book/myst-theme#503&lt;/a> adds new launch button functionality to
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> that allows readers to bring their own Binder / JupyterHub links for launching. (this is what necessitated the above two PRs)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a result of this upstream contribution loop, JupyterHub can now accept API requests at its &amp;ldquo;service discovery&amp;rdquo; endpoint, which means that Jupyter Book (and any other web application) can more easily learn about a hub&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to share this short vignette because it&amp;rsquo;s a good reflection of the kind of value that 2i2c tries to provide, given its role in helping to build and enhance networks of infrastructure, domain communities, and open source communities. In this case, we enabled a &lt;em>cross-project&lt;/em> workflow that required knowledge of each project, and a vision for how they could be used together in a way that exceeded the sum of their parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more potential in these kinds of workflows, and are eager to continue our work to identify and enhance community-centric infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/p>

The original request from Angus was interpreted as opening up the &lt;em>entire hub API&lt;/em> to external requests (which is a bad idea!) but we were able to quickly discuss this with the JupyterHub team to clarify that this was only about a very specific API endpoint. This is the kind of communication loop that often goes haywire when you have people contributing to a project without historical relationships to the project&amp;rsquo;s maintainers.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-home-nfs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/a> is a young project to provide flexible per-user home directory limits on JupyterHub - an important feature for controlling cloud costs.
&lt;a href="https://sunu.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Tarashish Mishra&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://sgibson91.github.io/cv/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sarah Gibson&lt;/a> have been leading this project for the last few months. Since we are moving away from
&lt;a href="https://aws.amazon.com/efs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >AWS Managed EFS&lt;/a> here, we had to do some work to recreate some of the benefits EFS gives us out of the box. During this quarter, we:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Set up automated backups so we can recover files in cases of disaster&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Set up automated alerting (via prometheus and pagerduty) to know if our backing EBS device is getting full and we need to perform a manual intervention&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Deployed this to a few other communities (
&lt;a href="https://www.cryocloud.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://nmfs-openscapes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NMFS Openscapes&lt;/a>) to broaden adoption.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>We will continue doing work on &lt;code>jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/code> in the upcoming quarter! If this is functionality you are interested in deploying, please reach out to us to collaborate!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This work in particular is a good demonstrator of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s value - it started off with a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >grant from GESIS&lt;/a>, and now with support from
&lt;a href="https://impact.earthdata.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA IMPACT&lt;/a> we are able to bring it to a &lt;em>lot&lt;/em> of communities, not just the ones that funded it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ongoing work here will focus on improving the UX as well as better documentation so users can actually use it!&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-jupyterhub/issues/59" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Tracking Issue&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had worked in the past with many communities in enabling
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/qgis-greenland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGIS on the Cloud&lt;/a>, and this quarter we got closer to enabling a contextual &amp;lsquo;Open in QGIS&amp;rsquo; button in the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/dashboard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >VEDA Dashboard&lt;/a>! Here is a quick demo:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./open-in-qgis.mp4" muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(This shows the workflow when user is already logged into the JupyterHub and had started the server)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can play with this in
&lt;a href="https://deploy-preview-688--ghg-demo.netlify.app/exploration" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this preview&lt;/a>, although you need to have access to the NASA VEDA hub to fully try it out at this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Tarashish from Development Seed is again responsible for most of the work here, available in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunu/jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy&lt;/a>. You can use it to create &amp;lsquo;magic links&amp;rsquo; that will open QGIS in a desktop environment in your browser, and add a specific layer to it! Our hope is that this allows primarily GIS folks to better use tools they already are familiar with in cloud based contexts.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://executablebooks.org/en/latest/blog/2024-05-20-jupyter-book-myst/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >our Jupyter Book 2 plan&lt;/a>, we intend for Jupyter Book to be an &amp;ldquo;opinionated distribution&amp;rdquo; of &lt;code>mystmd&lt;/code> that shares the same configuration format and CLI. This contrasts with Jupyter Book 1, which was built on top of the Sphinx documentation engine, but offered its own CLI and configuration files. In future, the &lt;code>jupyter book&lt;/code> and &lt;code>mystmd&lt;/code> CLIs may diverge from one another, but we expect that this will be handled in a graceful manner: &lt;code>mystmd&lt;/code> commands should always be compatible with the &lt;code>jupyter book&lt;/code> application.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Docker Stacks&lt;/a> project provides a collection of ready-to-use Docker images for Jupyter environments. These images are used by many in the Jupyter community, including 2i2c which uses them as base images for our JupyterHub deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project recently began publishing
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/1019" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ARM-compatible images&lt;/a> alongside the standard x86 images, making it easier for users with ARM-based systems (like M1 Macs) to use these environments. However, building and hosting these ARM images comes with additional cloud computing costs that were being personally covered by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mathbunnyru" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >@mathbunnyru&lt;/a>, one of the project&amp;rsquo;s maintainers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A part of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission is supporting upstream communities that we rely on, especially where the upstream project has limited resources. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to support Jupyter Docker Stack&amp;rsquo;s ARM building costs, with a total budget of &lt;code>$2000&lt;/code> (approximately &lt;code>$150&lt;/code> per month). As a regular user and beneficiary of the Jupyter Docker Stacks, we believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to contribute to the maintenance and sustainability of this crucial piece of infrastructure that benefits the entire Jupyter community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope this support helps the Docker Stacks project remain healthy, and continue providing high-quality, multi-architecture images that work across different computing platforms. We&amp;rsquo;ll revisit this decision as the landscape of technology providers changes and other options arise.&lt;/p>

Introduction
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Mybinder.org&lt;/a> enables researchers across the world to replicate computational environments in the cloud. It allows researchers to turn static code into interactive literate coding environments with a click of a button within seconds. The
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> service is powered by
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a>, an open-source tool developed by
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Jupyter Project&lt;/a> that many organizations have deployed for their own communities. It does this by _dynamically building _the software environment needed to reproduce a computation (using a tool called
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>), and making this environment available to users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BinderHub was developed for use-cases that are &lt;em>temporary&lt;/em> and &lt;em>fully open&lt;/em> by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past several years, the
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GESIS Notebooks&lt;/a> team made the first steps towards bridging this gap through their
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Persistent BinderHub&lt;/a> implementation. This was a modified and authenticated BinderHub that &lt;em>included&lt;/em> persistent storage across sessions. The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NFDI4DS&lt;/a> (GAN: 460234259),
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CESSDA&lt;/a>, and members of the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JMTE&lt;/a> project. This collaboration has three primary goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generalize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure&lt;/strong>, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects&lt;/strong>, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub&lt;/strong>, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See
&lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this GitHub Projects Board for issues that implement this effort&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">
Exploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the
&lt;a href="http://binderhub.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>. We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Persistent BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>. The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >modified Helm Chart&lt;/a> that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality &lt;em>natively&lt;/em> into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to take another approach:&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">
Exploration 2: Add dynamic image building to JupyterHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-2-add-dynamic-image-building-to-jupyterhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, &lt;strong>we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using
&lt;a href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a> project that
&lt;a href="https://quantstack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QuantStack&lt;/a> had built for the
&lt;a href="https://plasmabio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PlasmaBio project&lt;/a>. This implementation was seen as successful, and something others in the community had wanted to generalize for some time.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="two-phases-of-implementation">
Two phases of implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#two-phases-of-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a back-end for dynamic environment building&lt;/strong>. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and is easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are a few tasks that we’re carrying out next to make progress on the above two items.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a working prototype for image generation via a &lt;em>JupyterHub Service&lt;/em> (see below for current status)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research the &lt;code>tljh-repo2docker&lt;/code> code base to understand how we could build upon its UX and functionality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the typical process that GESIS and NFDI users follow in their BinderHub workflows, to ensure that it can be replicated via this new implementation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform UI/UX research validation to inform the implementation from a user’s perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a follow-up, we’ll likely re-work the BinderHub codebase to utilize JupyterHub’s new repo2docker service, rather than defining its own custom repo2docker functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">
Back-end implementation as a JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We’re planning to use
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Services&lt;/a> to add the back-end functionality for dynamic image building to a JupyterHub. Services are a way to expose functionality via a JupyterHub REST API, and would allow us to expose basic image generation on-the-fly with
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>. We aim for basic functionality to be as close as possible to repo2docker’s default behavior, but to make this functionality _composable and customizable _if a JupyterHub administrator wants to provide different out-of-the-box functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While details may still change, we believe that the major architectural plan has now been settled. We have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an experimental codebase&lt;/a> with a basic implementation of the repo2docker service described above. As part of this effort, this team has also made a number of improvements to repo2docker’s codebase and project infrastructure. We hope that this effort will continue to push resources and attention to repo2docker by growing the number of users and stakeholders that rely on the project for their success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">
Front-end implementation that uses this service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once the back-end setup exists, we can use it to begin prototyping user interactions that can trigger and use repo2docker’s image generation. Bringing dynamic environment image building into JupyterHub is a significant improvement in its functionality, and may introduce new kinds of workflows that we hadn’t initially imagined. Understanding, interpreting, and extending the original “Persistent BinderHub” workflow will require a more thorough understanding of user stories and needs in order to identify new workflows that feel natural not only in a JupyterHub scenario but also in a Binder-like scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here are a few major UI/UX questions we must answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When a user builds an image, should it also become available to &lt;em>other users&lt;/em> as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can a user store, find, and delete old images that they’ve built?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about new versions of the same image?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should we simply mimic the mybinder.org UX, or should this be improved as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We must answer these and several other questions next. With that vision in place, we’d like to &lt;strong>expand our efforts in UI/UX and user research&lt;/strong>. This will help inform the technical implementation of this work as we expand on our prototype, and help us choose the right way to expose this functionality to users. We welcome collaboration around this work - if you know of an organization that is interested in collaboration, please reach out.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After a few months working on this project, we are even more excited about the potential for dynamically building environments in a JupyterHub. We believe that it adds a new class of workflows to JupyterHubs that were not possible before, and will be immediately useful to the hundreds of communities that deploy JupyterHub for their communities.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
