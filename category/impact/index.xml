&lt;p>We have developed the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/gcp-filestore-backups" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>gcp-filestore-backups&lt;/code> project&lt;/a> that regularly creates backups of JupyterHub home directories for disaster recovery purposes. The project is a Python wrapper around the
&lt;a href="https://cloud.google.com/sdk/gcloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>gcloud&lt;/code> tool&lt;/a> to regularly request backups be made of the Filestore hosting JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s user home directories, by default on a daily basis. The script also manages retention of these backups by checking how recently the last backup was made, and the age of existing backups, by default deleting any backup older than 5 days.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having these backups enabled means that, in the unlikely and unfortunate case of data loss or corruption, we can reinstate the home directories of the hub to a relatively recent state that is at a maximum of 1 day prior to the incident.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have deployed &lt;code>gcp-filestore-backups&lt;/code> to all our GCP hubs presently running, with a retention period of 2 days. If you would like to discuss this further with us,
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >please get in touch!&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is a massive public service for creating and sharing reproducible computational environments. It is managed by the JupyterHub team and
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/about/federation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >members of the &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> federation&lt;/a>. One challenge in running
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&lt;/a> is identifying cloud credits or financial resources to support the cloud infrastructure that runs the service. Two years ago,
&lt;a href="https://medium.com/jupyter-blog/mybinder-org-reducing-capacity-c93ccfc6413f" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Google stopped supporting &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> federation with cloud credits&lt;/a>, and last month
&lt;a href="https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/mybinder-org-reduced-capacity-stability/31750" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the federation lost more capacity&lt;/a>, leaving only
&lt;a href="https://www.gesis.org/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GESIS&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://us.ovhcloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OVH&lt;/a> as remaining federation members&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. This makes &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> less reliable, slower, and generally less useful to the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The landscape of cloud infrastructure technology and services has changed considerably, and we think that there&amp;rsquo;s a way to deploy BinderHub instances with lower costs and less complexity. We&amp;rsquo;ve accomplished this by deploying a &lt;strong>single-node Kubernetes cluster&lt;/strong> on a VM provider that is much cheaper, now running at &lt;code>2i2c.mybinder.org&lt;/code>. This both relieves Binder&amp;rsquo;s short-term capacity shortage and may provide an easier pathway for others to support the project in the future.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below, we&amp;rsquo;ll describe what has changed to enable this, what we&amp;rsquo;re deploying, and what the impact should be.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cloud-infrastructure-has-become-cheaper-and-more-commodified">
Cloud infrastructure has become cheaper and more commodified
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cloud-infrastructure-has-become-cheaper-and-more-commodified">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A key theory of mybinder.org (and 2i2c) is that commercial cloud infrastructure will be commidified over time &amp;ndash; what begins as cutting-edge functionality will become commonplace and offered across all cloud providers. As a result, costs will go down over time. Abstractions like
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kubernetes&lt;/a> will allow you to easily migrate workflows and infrastructure between cloud providers. As a result, you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to easily &lt;em>follow those costs&lt;/em> where there are better options. That&amp;rsquo;s essentially what is happening here.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are two key changes that make it much easier to deploy a BinderHub instance at a fraction of the cost:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>First, &lt;strong>Kubernetes has matured and become easier to deploy&lt;/strong>. When mybinder.org started, it was using the cutting-edge of Kubernetes functionality. This meant that we needed to use cloud providers that provided a &lt;em>managed Kubernetes service&lt;/em> to deal with this complexity. A managed Kubernetes offering tends to be expensive, offered by only a few cloud providers, and thus raises costs across-the-board for the provider that offers it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, this was almost a decade ago, and Kubernetes has become both more functional and more stable. There are now many more ways of running Kubernetes, especially for simpler workflows that don&amp;rsquo;t require autoscaling. In the last several months, we&amp;rsquo;ve been experimenting with &lt;strong>single-node Kubernetes workflows&lt;/strong> via
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a>&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a> is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution that is much easier to deploy and manage. It&amp;rsquo;s designed for things like edge computing and low-resource environments, and it can be deployed with a single script!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By running a Kubernetes cluster on a single node, we don&amp;rsquo;t need a &amp;ldquo;managed Kubernetes service&amp;rdquo;, which means &lt;strong>we can choose from a much larger pool of infrastructure / cloud providers&lt;/strong>. If all we need is a running VM, this is something the tech industry has been doing for decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, &lt;strong>Managed Object Storage services have more open source options, and are more commodified and cheaper&lt;/strong>. In addition to Kubernetes, the other thing that BinderHub needs is a way to store and retrieve images for the environments that it builds. This also used to be a fairly complex problem, and thus required managed solutions from cloud providers that charged a premium for their service. However, a number of open source object storage solutions have emerged and made it much easier for providers to support this workflow.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Because these are open source, infrastructure providers can provide managed object storage at a fraction of the cost.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Because of these two things, we&amp;rsquo;ve learned that we can run a BinderHub instance on a single VM from a much larger pool of infrastructure providers. This means &lt;strong>we should be able to run BinderHub instances at a fraction of the cost&lt;/strong>.&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>

Deploying BinderHub on a single-node VM is cheaper and simpler
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#deploying-binderhub-on-a-single-node-vm-is-cheaper-and-simpler">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Last week, we
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/mybinder.org-deploy/pull/3169" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >deployed 2i2c.mybinder.org&lt;/a>, a single-node Kubernetes instance on
&lt;a href="https://hetzner.com/cloud" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hetzner&lt;/a> cloud using
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a>. This will run on a single node VM, with a Kubernetes instance that is entirely managed by us, and with managed object storage from Hetzner. Compared to other cloud providers, it is &lt;strong>around 5x cheaper per month&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Running a single-node Kubernetes instance will be a cheap and effective way to handle a lot of &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo;s capacity needs. Because it&amp;rsquo;s a single node cluster, there is no auto-scaling (one reason it is so cheap), which reduces a lot of the complexity we&amp;rsquo;ll have to manage. These are acceptable tradeoffs for a service like &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>, which runs entirely ephemeral sessions with very limited resources and no promises about uptime, persistence, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You might be wondering: &amp;ldquo;I thought Kubernetes was supposed to &lt;em>save money&lt;/em>.&amp;rdquo; Normally, running Kubernetes for scalable workflows does save costs because you can scale infrastructure to match your capacity needs. Without scaling, you&amp;rsquo;d need to provide a VM that can &lt;em>always&lt;/em> handle your &lt;em>maximum capacity&lt;/em> needs (and pay for the costs the entire time). With Kubernetes, you can request and remove nodes to grow your capacity as-needed (and save money doing so). It looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-the-cost-difference-between-a-single-large-vm-vs-scalable-nodes-given-variable-usage-over-time-kubernetes-allows-you-to-scale-your-cost-up-and-down-with-need-which-is-more-efficient-than-paying-for-a-single-vm-that-can-withstand-your-maximum-capacity">

&lt;/div>&lt;figcaption>
The cost difference between a single large VM vs scalable nodes. Given variable usage over time, kubernetes allows you to scale your cost up and down with need, which is more efficient than paying for a single VM that can withstand your maximum capacity.
&lt;/figcaption>&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>However, there is a built-in cost you pay when you use a service that provides managed Kubernetes. &lt;strong>Managed Kubernetes services are complex and expensive&lt;/strong>, and this is reflected across-the-board in the provider&amp;rsquo;s costs. What if we could achieve the same outcome with a much simpler cloud offering like a single VM?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We did a bit of research and discovered that the Kubernetes and object storage landscape has indeed evolved significantly since the early days of mybinder.org. For example,
&lt;a href="https://www.hetzner.com/cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hetzner&lt;/a> is a cloud provider that has been around for a long time. It has single-node VMs that are about &lt;code>4x&lt;/code> cheaper than their counterparts in Google Cloud or AWS, and provides managed object storage that uses
&lt;a href="https://min.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MinIO&lt;/a> in a cost-effective way. Using
&lt;a href="https://k3s.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >K3s&lt;/a>, we can run a lightweight, single-node Kubernetes runtime on this node, and deploy a BinderHub with the same infrastructure as any other BinderHub federation member.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By our estimate, we could fit around &lt;strong>400 simultaneous sessions&lt;/strong> on &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code> (because each session uses very few cloud resources). This is already the majority of mybinder.org&amp;rsquo;s capacity needs, and at a much lower cost than using a scalable Kubernetes cluster. The cost picture looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure id="figure-if-your-single-vm-is-much-cheaper-it-might-still-be-the-cheapest-option-in-the-case-of-a-hetzner-vm-it-has-roughly-the-same-capacity-as-another-cloud-providers-vm-but-at-14-of-the-cost">

&lt;p>For now, 2i2c is sponsoring a max of €350 a month (with some currency conversion noise) to run this service. We&amp;rsquo;ll provide in-kind labor to run this node, and treat it as an organizational investment in supporting open science, as well as learning new Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure workflows. We&amp;rsquo;re going to use funds recovered from communities in our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/platform/" >community hub network&lt;/a>, along with in-kind labor to build out this experiment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In six months, we&amp;rsquo;ll evaluate how much effort it was to run this node for &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>, whether it meaningfully helped with &lt;code>mybinder.org&lt;/code>&amp;rsquo;s capacity, and whether it was sustainable for us from a time and labor perspective.&lt;/p>

To this end, 2i2c in close collaboration with
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a> have developed the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/jupyterhub-home-nfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub-home-nfs&lt;/code> project&lt;/a> which is a Helm chart that permits enforcing per-user quotas on the storage space.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-note">
&lt;div>
Note that this feature is currently available to AWS hosted hubs only and will be rolled out to other cloud providers in the future.
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>Under the hood, the Helm chart runs
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nfs-ganesha/nfs-ganesha" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NFS Ganesha&lt;/a> as an in-cluster NFS server, backed by
&lt;a href="https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-xfs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >XFS&lt;/a> as the underlying filesystem. Storage quota is enforced through XFS&amp;rsquo;s native quota management utility &lt;code>xfs_quota&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this feature moves our infrastructure away from managed filesystems (such as AWS&amp;rsquo;s Elastic File System) that cannot support per-user storage quotas, we have also developed monitoring and alerting mechanisms that will let us know when the disks are getting full, and automated back-ups for disaster recovery.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you would like to try this on your 2i2c-managed hub,
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >please get in touch&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This project can also be used with &lt;em>any&lt;/em> Kubernetes-based JupyterHub, as per our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Right to Replicate policy&lt;/a>, so please try it out on your own deployment and let us know what you think!&lt;/p>

While this usually isn&amp;rsquo;t a big deal, it means that there is a missed opportunity to grow the impact of an ecosystem because it requires coordinated development among multiple stakeholders within it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is one of the reasons we created 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s open community hub platform. By deploying a single platform that utilizes entirely open infrastructure that we contribute back to, we have visibility over a variety of projects along with the need to combine them together for a specific end-user outcome. One-such development scenario recently came up involving
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Allowing readers to &amp;ldquo;bring their own Binders&amp;rdquo;
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#allowing-readers-to-bring-their-own-binders">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve recently been working to integrate
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> workflows with our community hubs for a more seamless experience (for example, having book pages link back to interactive cloud sessions that allow users to interact with the content). We imagine a network of Jupyter Books that all build upon the same core infrastructures (JupyterHub, Binder, etc) for cloud-based computing. Our hope is to allow a user to &lt;em>bring their own Binder&lt;/em> with them so that they can interact with another book&amp;rsquo;s content with their own cloud infrastructure. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A student with access to &lt;code>binder.myuniversity.edu&lt;/code> could read a Jupyter Book created by a professor at &lt;code>otheruniversity.edu&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The Jupyter Book is defined with a
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specification.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Binder specification&lt;/a> that has a recipe for re-building the environment needed to run te book&amp;rsquo;s content.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>From the professor&amp;rsquo;s book, the student can choose to launch an interactive Binder sessions on &lt;em>their university&amp;rsquo;s Binder&lt;/em>, allowing them to interact with the book&amp;rsquo;s content on their own infrastructure.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We want a workflow like this to be as seamless and un-complicated as possible. We also want it to follow the same fundamental workflow as the
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/community/content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller-based launch buttons&lt;/a>. Along the way, we realized that we needed to coordinate development across
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a>],
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a>, and

Getting Jupyter Book to discover Jupyter Hub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#getting-jupyter-book-to-discover-jupyter-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As we began developing this workflow, we realized that there was a blocker in the JupyterHub and BinderHub ecosystem that needed to be fixed. We needed a way to &lt;strong>ask a JupyterHub whether it had an unauthenticated end-point for service discovery&lt;/strong>. Basically, a way to ask a hub &amp;ldquo;what kind of hub are you, and how can we launch an interactive session on you?&amp;rdquo; Doing this is simple-enough - JupyterHub already has a way of reporting its version and application type, which allows us to infer how to launch interactive sessions. But, we hit a snag in an HTML context.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, JupyterHub disallows certain kinds of
&lt;a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Cross-Origin Resource Sharing&lt;/a> (CORS) requests, in order to restrict other applications from abusing a JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API. If you hit parts of a JupyterHub API from &lt;em>the command line&lt;/em>, things work fine. But if you do the same thing via JavaScript from a website, the request is disallowed. This was a problem if we want Jupyter Book (a web application) to be able to make requests of JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we realized that we needed to make an &lt;strong>upstream contribution in JupyterHub&lt;/strong> in order to &lt;strong>enable an interaction between JupyterHub and Jupyter Book&lt;/strong>. In this case, it was a relatively simple fix: allowing CORS requests for the specific API endpoint we needed (which is a very lightweight endpoint that is not vulnerable to security risks, and is broadly useful to make accessible)&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. That resulted in two PRs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/pull/4966" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/jupyterhub#4966&lt;/a> allows CORS requests for the API that was needed for service discovery in JupyterHub.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1906" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyterhub/binderhub#1906&lt;/a> enables this workflow on a BinderHub so that its services can be discovered.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/pull/503" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;i class='fa-brands fa-github'>&lt;/i> jupyter-book/myst-theme#503&lt;/a> adds new launch button functionality to
&lt;a href="https://next.jupyterbook.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book 2&lt;/a> that allows readers to bring their own Binder / JupyterHub links for launching. (this is what necessitated the above two PRs)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a result of this upstream contribution loop, JupyterHub can now accept API requests at its &amp;ldquo;service discovery&amp;rdquo; endpoint, which means that Jupyter Book (and any other web application) can more easily learn about a hub&amp;rsquo;s capabilities and version.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We wanted to share this short vignette because it&amp;rsquo;s a good reflection of the kind of value that 2i2c tries to provide, given its role in helping to build and enhance networks of infrastructure, domain communities, and open source communities. In this case, we enabled a &lt;em>cross-project&lt;/em> workflow that required knowledge of each project, and a vision for how they could be used together in a way that exceeded the sum of their parts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We think there&amp;rsquo;s a lot more potential in these kinds of workflows, and are eager to continue our work to identify and enhance community-centric infrastructure for interactive computing.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>This actually required an interesting bit of team discussion that was much easier with a few 2i2c staff on the JupyterHub team. The original request from Angus was interpreted as opening up the &lt;em>entire hub API&lt;/em> to external requests (which is a bad idea!) but we were able to quickly discuss this with the JupyterHub team to clarify that this was only about a very specific API endpoint. This is the kind of communication loop that often goes haywire when you have people contributing to a project without historical relationships to the project&amp;rsquo;s maintainers.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Project Pythia is an open access educational initiative established with funding from the U.S. National Science Foundation. Its mission is to help students and scientists enhance their skills and adopt best practices using the tools and technologies of open science. As part of the Pangeo community, Project Pythia primarily focuses on the Pangeo stack, which includes cloud computing, Jupyter technologies, GitHub, and various software packages in the Scientific Python ecosystem, centered around Xarray. Project Pythia offers a wide range of open access content, such as datasets, software, tutorials, and annotated real-world workflows presented in the form of Jupyter Books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Project Pythia serves as a resource for scientists, promoting and fostering open science. Although it is not a scientific research artifact itself, the development of Project Pythia adheres to many best practices advocated by open science proponents. The Pythia team actively encourages community engagement and collaborates openly with scientists and technologists to create new content. All Pythia resources are freely accessible, and the project follows the FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) for managing research outputs, including publications, data, and other materials. We support and facilitate open evaluation and peer reviews of content to ensure verifiability and trust. Lastly, we endeavor to openly discuss ideas, designs, and methods before implementation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This presentation will provide an overview of Project Pythia&amp;rsquo;s extensive educational resources and share our experiences in applying many open science principles to develop this flagship training resource for the geoscience community.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-1">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The NASA Plankton, Aerosol, Cloud, ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission, while bringing NASA&amp;rsquo;s Earth System Observatory &lt;em>up to speed&lt;/em> with aquatic, atmospheric, and terrestrial science capabilities, is also providing data records of the Earth System for the next generation of scientists &lt;em>to grow into&lt;/em>. The goal of the PACE Hackweek, supported by the Ocean Carbon &amp;amp; Biogeochemistry program and hosted at the University of Maryland Baltimore County in August 2024, was to enrich and support the practice of open science by both emerging and established researchers. Cloud-compute resources for the event were provided by CryoCloud, a NASA funded collaboration between ICESat-2 and the International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c) to provide cryosphere researchers with a shared JupyterHub. We, the hackweek mentors, were buoyed by the NASA Openscapes program and adopted its mantra of striving toward &amp;ldquo;a kinder science for future us.&amp;rdquo; Participants faced two novelties: the &amp;ldquo;firehose&amp;rdquo; of data from the PACE instrument array (a hyper-spectral imaging spectrometer, a wide-swath hyper-angular polarimeter, and a narrow-swath spectro-polarimeter), and the distribution of PACE collections through the NASA Earthdata Cloud (a first for the Ocean Biology Distributed Active Archive Center). We present our approach and the challenges undertaken to hold an in-person, social coding event with 45 participants that provided a collaborative, supportive launchpad for doing open science with PACE. All lectures and tutorials produced for the event are freely available for examination and reuse. Our results additionally include highlights from the demonstration projects pursued by event participants and results from two post-event, qualitative surveys. One anonymous survey gathered participant feedback that will inform plans for growing these 45 participants into a lasting, open community. A separate, anonymous survey recorded participant demographics in order to evaluate our efforts at increasing diversity within the community of PACE data users. Key points of discussion include participant views, informed by our event, on whether and how the NASA Earthdata Cloud is a significant resource for the practice of open science with PACE, and how a shared JupyterHub can further the practice of open science by the community it serves.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>If we&amp;rsquo;re asking people to change for open science, we must be willing to change ourselves. Internalizing this as individuals and institutions is critical - &amp;ldquo;to address our climate emergency, we must rapidly, radically reshape society. We need every solution and every solver&amp;rdquo; (Johnson &amp;amp; Wilkinson, All We Can Save).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Radically reshaping our society and including more solvers requires Earth scientists of all disciplines, across AGU, to work together in new ways. Many of these shifts can be considered Open science. They change how we work daily, not just the open products we produce. And for that, people need to consider themselves part of a team, let go of perfection and embrace a growth mindset to continually reflect and improve skills – no matter their job title. Further, open science requires all of us to see ourselves as leaders making small changes that collectively add up to a movement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Openscapes is an open source approach to cultivating leaders and change makers. Openscapes&amp;rsquo; flywheel approach intervenes and builds momentum through identifying mentors within organizations and mentoring teams curious about shifting to open science (Robinson &amp;amp; Lowndes 2022). Collectively, the Openscapes flywheel iterations have had a significant impact over the past five years across institutions like the federal government and academia that seem impossible to change. Through stories working with professional scientists over the past 5 years including at NASA, NOAA, Black Women in Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Science, and many universities, and open source software communities like 2i2c, Posit, Pangeo, and RLadies, we will share actionable insights for flourishing in the open science commons, and are interested in learning with and growing flywheel momentum further at AGU.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-3">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The Earth Observation (EO) industry has seen rapid technological advancements alongside a massive increase in the number of private and public missions, leading to exponentially growing data archives. For publicly funded entities, this data is typically required to be freely available. However, open data does not always guarantee accessibility, and significant barriers remain for even the most advanced users. The stagnation in the use and adoption of open data can be attributed to several factors, including 1) challenges in unifying and maintaining metadata standards, 2) inefficiencies associated with legacy data formats, 3) a lack of training and resources for transitioning to cloud-based infrastructure, and 4) systemic social inequalities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This talk will explore real-life examples of these barriers and highlight success stories that have emerged from partnerships largely originating within open-source communities which foster diverse connections between private and public entities including efforts like GeoZarr, pangeo-forge, Openscapes and 2i2c. While many advancements in improving the usability and accessibility of EO data have come from private efforts (i.e. Google Earth Engine), the shutdown of the Planetary Computer is a reminder of the need for publicly funded alternatives. The sustainability of open source projects will be addressed, with questions posed around reliable funding mechanisms as a means to ensure equitable development to address barriers and ensure accessibility for all. While this talk will be presented by one individual, it is the review and reflection of the work done by dozens of people across various organizations.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The EarthScope Consortium manages NSF&amp;rsquo;s GAGE and SAGE facilities and makes all of its geophysical data available in a commercial cloud system. This enables EarthScope and the communities it supports to leverage the abundant computational resources and cost-effective benefits of adopting data-proximate workflows with direct access to large, analysis-ready geophysical data sets.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In recent years, JupyterHub environments have gained popularity with data enthusiasts for their ability to provide open access to powerful compute resources. As part of a broad effort to support communities with intuitive resources to quickly adapt their workflows to the cloud, EarthScope has partnered with 2i2c to operate a scalable JupyterHub environment in AWS that will provide equitable access to cloud compute resources for researchers, educators, and the general public. GeoLab, the EarthScope hub, is aligned with related open science initiatives to establish rigorous and transparent standards for reproducible, data-intensive workflows. In addition to promoting interdisciplinary and inter-institutional collaborative work between researchers in GeoLab, EarthScope is developing and hosting workshops that can support both in-person and asynchronous learning modules that will train users how to utilize these new resources and transition their work to the cloud. We are excited to invite all geophysical data users to participate in the vigorous growth of this new platform and collaborate with adjacent open-science compute hub initiatives.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-5">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Project Pythia is the flagship education and training initiative of the Pangeo community. Pangeo has advanced transformative platforms and paradigms for &amp;ldquo;Big Data&amp;rdquo; geoscience in the cloud; Pythia is creating on-ramps for new users with open, interactive learning resources centered on Python in the geosciences. Pythia is now building a vibrant community-owned clearinghouse of accessible, reusable, and reproducible tutorials and exemplar workflows in the cloud known as Pythia Cookbooks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Cookbooks&amp;rdquo; imply collections of recipes for transforming raw ingredients (publicly available data) into scientifically useful results. Based on Jupyter notebooks, Cookbooks are explicitly tied to reproducible computational environments and supported by a rich cloud-based infrastructure enabling collaborative authoring and automated health-checking – essential tools in the struggle against the widespread notebook obsolescence problem. Cookbooks are hosted on Pythia&amp;rsquo;s searchable gallery and nurtured by a growing community of open science enthusiasts from across the geosciences. The Pythia Cookbook gallery is essentially a crowd-sourced, community-curated collection of best practices for data analysis and visualization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here we will outline the stack of technologies and infrastructure enabling cookbook creation, collaboration, testing, publication, and interactive deployment, and how these are used in service of building an inclusive participatory community. We will discuss existing technical and social hurdles for contributors, as well as new infrastructure developments in collaboration with the Executable Books Project that are reducing these hurdles.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-6">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>In this talk we will highlight our NASA Openscapes community teaching approach to using the 2i2c-managed JupyterHub – how we&amp;rsquo;ve collaboratively developed it to meet user needs, and how it continues to enable researchers and users of NASA Earthdata in the new Cloud paradigm.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>NASA Openscapes is an open source mentor community across NASA Earth science data centers (
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/eosdis/daacs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >DAACs&lt;/a>) that helps users explore and use the Cloud for their science and applications.
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/earthdata-cloud-cookbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Earthdata Cloud Cookbook&lt;/a> is a learner-focused open source tutorial collection that we update openly as we learn together.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A critical piece of the NASA Openscapes effort is our &lt;strong>NASA Openscapes 2i2c JupyterHub&lt;/strong>, a managed cloud computing space. By working with cloud early adopters and science
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io/news/2024-07-24-2024-nasa-champions-cohort/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Champions&lt;/a>, responding and co-developing solutions, the JupyterHub has evolved since its early days in 2021. We support cloud computing for several languages (python, R, Matlab, QGIS) and common science libraries with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/nasa-openscapes/corn" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >corn&lt;/a>; we streamlined how to bulk-add workshop participants via GitHub Teams; we established policy and technology for a special authentication mechanism for large scale workshops; we are developing earthaccess as an community-developed python library for NASA Earthdata search and access, whether locally or in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Based on the last 3 years of engaging with the user community and the Hub, we have &lt;strong>evolved&lt;/strong> how we &lt;strong>onboard&lt;/strong> (first experience in the cloud) and &lt;strong>fledge&lt;/strong> (set up for Cloud that includes a plan, how to do it, how to pay for it; leaving the nest and perhaps building your own). Fledging is an important part of adoption and initiating users to the Cloud - where do researchers go when they decide to do their science in the Cloud? We&amp;rsquo;ve been developing practices that aim to be equitable and consider policy (cost), technical (where do people go, what admin setup is needed, what tech like base images etc are needed), and social (how do I learn, get support) aspects, and look forward to discussing further at AGU.&lt;/p>

Abstract
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#abstract-7">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Numerical models are essential for forecasting volcanic hazards for both short-term responses and long-term hazard assessment. While many models of volcanic processes already exist, challenges in finding, installing, and evaluating these models, coupled with limited computational resources, hinder their widespread use. To address this, we introduce VICTOR, the Volcanology Infrastructure for Computational Tools and Resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR is a cutting-edge cyber-infrastructure platform offering an open-source, cloud-based environment tailored for the volcanology community. It features Jupyter notebooks that integrate existing volcano models, such as the lava flow codes MOLASSES and IMEX_lava, the tephra and ash dispersal codes Tephra2 and HYSPLIT, and the mass flow code TITAN2D. The backend of VICTOR is managed as a JupyterHub, operated by the non-profit 2i2c under the Code for Science and Society.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR not only provides access to individual modeling tools, but also hosts workflows that use them in data inversion, model benchmarking, and uncertainty quantification. For example, we developed a workflow to validate mass flow models using multiple metrics and Bayesian statistics. VICTOR provides built-in access to external databases such as OpenTopography, Copernicus, and NASA&amp;rsquo;s remote sensing products to streamline obtaining and using data in workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR also serves as an educational resource. In Spring 2023 and 2024 we taught graduate level, multi-institutional courses in Computational Volcanology using VICTOR, and we are creating multilingual tutorials for the workflows. We are developing teaching modules on topics such as lava flows and remote sensing to be shared with instructors. Lastly, VICTOR collaborates with national efforts including CONVERSE and SZ4D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In summary, VICTOR addresses the critical need for accessible, effective volcanic hazard modeling tools and resources, fostering advancements in both research and education within the volcanology community.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="plain-language-summary">
Plain-language Summary
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#plain-language-summary">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>VICTOR is a new online platform designed to help scientists predict volcanic hazards more easily. Traditional models can be difficult to find, use, and combine with other tools. VICTOR solves these problems by offering a cloud-based, open-source environment with user-friendly tools.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR includes tools like Jupyter notebooks that combine various volcano models for lava flows, ash dispersal, and mass movements. It operates through JupyterHub, managed by the non-profit 2i2c. The platform not only provides access to these models but also offers workflows for tasks like data analysis and model validation. For example, it has a workflow for testing mass flow models using multiple evaluation methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>VICTOR simplifies data access by connecting directly to databases like OpenTopography and NASA&amp;rsquo;s remote sensing products. It&amp;rsquo;s also an educational tool, used in graduate courses and offering multilingual tutorials. Additionally, VICTOR is developing teaching materials on topics like lava flows and remote sensing and collaborates with national projects like CONVERSE and SZ4D.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In essence, VICTOR makes volcanic hazard modeling more accessible and effective, benefiting both research and education in volcanology.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This project aims to make it easier for administrators to provide a service that enables users to &lt;strong>submit code and data&lt;/strong> that are &lt;strong>evaluated on secure infrastructure with access to private data and resources&lt;/strong>. It also provides a leaderboard that helps users compare their performance against others.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>It is designed to be lightweight and flexible, and can be run on a variety of shared infrastructure. For those who wish to run this project on cloud infrastructure, we&amp;rsquo;ve also published a
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/frx-challenges-helm-chart/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Helm Chart to help you deploy &lt;code>frx-challenges&lt;/code> with Kubernetes&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While it can be run on its own, we believe that it naturally complements other tools and services for interactive computing and data, such as &lt;strong>JupyterHub&lt;/strong>, &lt;strong>Jupyter Book&lt;/strong>, and &lt;strong>Binder&lt;/strong>. More on that below.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Below is a brief description of the motivation behind this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-are-frictionless-research-exchanges">
What are Frictionless Research Exchanges
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-are-frictionless-research-exchanges">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The project is heavily inspired by David Donoho&amp;rsquo;s vision of &lt;strong>Frictionless Research Exchanges&lt;/strong> (FRX) as described in
&lt;a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00865" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;em>Data Science at the Singularity&lt;/em>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this article, Donoho describes three key pillars for Frictionless Research Exchanges:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The three initiatives are related but separate; and all three have to come together, and in a particularly strong way, to provide the conditions for the new era. Here they are:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>[FR-1: Data] datafication of everything, with a culture of research data sharing. One can now find datasets publicly available online on a bewildering variety of topics, from chest x-rays to cosmic microwave background measurements to uber routes to geospatial crop identifications.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[FR-2: Re-execution] research code sharing including the ability to exactly re-execute the same complete workflow by different researchers.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>[FR-3: Challenges] adopting challenge problems as a new paradigm powering scientific research. The paradigm includes: a shared public dataset, a prescribed and quantified task performance metric, a set of enrolled competitors seeking to outperform each other on the task, and a public leaderboard. Thousands of such challenges with millions of entries have now taken place, across many fields.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>We considered the landscape of tools and services, and felt that [FR-1] and [FR-2] were already well-served by a variety of tools and services for community workspace infrastructure (e.g., JupyterHub:
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub.readthedocs.io&lt;/a>), sharable computational environments (e.g., BinderHub:
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >binderhub.readthedocs.io&lt;/a>), authoring and reading computational narratives (e.g., Jupyter Book:
&lt;a href="https://jupyterbook.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterbook.org&lt;/a> and MyST:
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mystmd.org&lt;/a>), and data I/O tools and standards (e.g., Zarr:
&lt;a href="https://zarr.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >zarr.readthedocs.io&lt;/a> and Intake:
&lt;a href="https://intake.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >intake.readthedocs.io&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However there was a natural missing piece for &lt;strong>[FR-3 Challenges]&lt;/strong>, and we could not identify any community-managed infrastructure that facilitated data challenges. This is the goal of &lt;code>frx-challenges&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="why-facilitate-data-challenges">
Why facilitate data challenges?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#why-facilitate-data-challenges">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Data challenges are harder than you think! While it is simple enough to run somebody else&amp;rsquo;s code locally, data challenges require a systematic, secure, and automated approach to accepting and evaluating submissions in a fair and repeatable way. Here are some of the big challenges to tackle:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Submissions must retain user and team identity&lt;/strong>, which means that we must keep track of users and their submissions over time, since data challenges are designed to encourage iterative improvement and optimization.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluations must use potentially complex resources and data&lt;/strong> since many data challenges operate by publicly sharing a small dataset, and then running it against a much more complex dataset.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluations must be totally secure&lt;/strong>, so that submissions can&amp;rsquo;t do nefarious things like mine cryptocurrency or extract the challenge&amp;rsquo;s private data in unintended ways.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluations must be automated&lt;/strong>, so that running the challenge does not require extensive human intervention and can scale to many users.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Evaluation must be flexible&lt;/strong>, so that the infrastructure can accept a variety of types of submissions (e.g. code, data, model weights, etc), run them with arbitrary environments designed by the organizers, and run them with the right hardware to get the job done.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>These are just a few of the major challenges that we&amp;rsquo;ve tried to address with &lt;code>frx-challenges&lt;/code>, and we&amp;rsquo;re excited to see how it goes with our first assisted community challenge: the
&lt;a href="https://cellmapchallenge.janelia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Cellmap Challenge&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This is still the &lt;strong>very early stages&lt;/strong> of the project, and we imagine it will evolve significantly. We welcome feedback for how it can more effectively serve a variety of communities.&lt;/p>

In Kubernetes based JupyterHub environments, a

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
(Profile List for the NASA VEDA JupyterHub with &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last week, we rolled this new experience out to all 2i2c managed JupyterHubs! Here&amp;rsquo;s a quick rundown of what this enables:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Descriptions for choices in the dropdowns, making it much easier for users to know what they are getting with each environment (or resource selection).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Fully backwards compatible with the existing KubeSpawner profile list implementation. In our PR to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/5083" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >roll this out&lt;/a> to all hubs, you notice that we didn&amp;rsquo;t have to change the structure of any profile lists! So you can safely roll this out to your hubs too without needing to fundamentally change how your profiles are set up.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>It is a modern web app (built with
&lt;a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >react&lt;/a>), just like the JupyterHub admin panel. This allows us to evolve and satisfy user needs much faster, as well as expanding the pool of people who can contribute to the project!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Support for dynamically building images using
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> style repositories! It talks to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >binderhub&lt;/a> API so users can build reproducible environments as they wish without admin involvement nor needing to fully understand how docker and containers work. Our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >earlier blog post&lt;/a> has more information.&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>This is just the start, and thanks to ongoing funding from the
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/tools/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA&lt;/a> project, we are going to continue making improvements to this experience.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The Catalyst Project is a community-engaged initiative designed to support the adoption of open science principles in under-served bioscientific research communities through the provision of reliable and sustainable cloud computing infrastructure. It’s a project we’ve been working on now for almost two years, which involves staff from seven different organizations:
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://carpentries.org/about/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >The Carpentries&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://ccad.unc.edu.ar/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CCAD&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://www.cscce.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CSCCE&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://investinopen.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >IOI&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="http://metadocencia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MetaDocencia&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a href="http://openlifesci.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OLS&lt;/a>, and is funded by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key part of the project is engaging with Community Partners in Africa and Latin America: Institutions, organizations, and individuals who are undertaking bioscientific research projects that require cloud computing infrastructure. As collaborators on the Catalyst Project, Community Partners can access and use 2i2c’s open science cloud services, and also receive training from 2i2c, The Carpentries, MetaDocencia, and OLS to support their work.
&lt;a href="https://catalystproject.cloud/current-community-partners.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Community Partners&lt;/a> also play a vital role in shaping an evolving governance model for the Catalyst Project to help sustain, scale, and maximize impact in Latin America, Africa, and under-served communities around the world.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Creating a series of blog posts to highlight the work of the Catalyst Community Partners was a collaborative effort involving staff from CSCCE, 2i2c, OLS, and MetaDocencia. Specifically, Lou Woodley, Katie Pratt, Jenny Wong, and Tajuddeen Gwadabe conceived the idea during our regular Catalyst Project “website team” meetings, and developed a strategy for reaching out to community partners to gather information.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Katie then led that outreach, which involved a representative of each Community Partners completing a Google Form to answer three key questions and sharing a photo (or a selection of photos) to use on the blog. Katie curated all of the information, edited together the blog posts, and secured sign-off from all of the partners. Sabrina López and her team at MetaDocencia coordinated the translation of the posts from English to Spanish, and Jenny formatted and published them on the website.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We’re grateful to the Community Partners for generously sharing more about their work – and we look forward to highlighting more Catalyst Project Community Partners soon!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pancakes are the future of geophysical data processing</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-earthscope-pancakes/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-earthscope-pancakes/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Openscapes goes to the White House!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-openscapes-whitehouse/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-openscapes-whitehouse/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Hub Champion Training Reflections (English)</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-hub-champion-training/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-hub-champion-training/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Reflexiones sobre la formación de Campeones y Campeonas del Hub (Español)</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-hub-champion-training-es/</link><pubDate>Wed, 04 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/external-hub-champion-training-es/</guid><description/></item><item><title>MyST Mini-Hackathon with the DeepLabCut Team</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/deeplabcut-myst-hackathon/</link><pubDate>Mon, 02 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/deeplabcut-myst-hackathon/</guid><description>

&lt;a href="http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >DeepLabCut team&lt;/a> is a group of researchers and developers who are working on open source tools for analyzing animal pose estimation by training deep neural networks on videos.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Chris Holdgraf visited the lab in early August to learn more about how the group were using open-source tools to document and share their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyter-book-and-myst">
Jupyter Book and MyST
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyter-book-and-myst">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Extensive documentation for using the DeepLabCut software package is already available as a
&lt;a href="https://deeplabcut.github.io/DeepLabCut/README.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Book&lt;/a>. The group was interested in adopting MyST Markdown to stay ahead of the curve and upgrade their Jupyter Book (see the related announcement

&lt;p>Chris led a mini-hackathon to introduce the group to MyST and collect feedback on where enhancement features could be made in the future. Here&amp;rsquo;s a summary of the outcomes:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Many improvements were made to the
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST documentation&lt;/a> 📖
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST Quick Start Guide&lt;/a> was used to onboard new users. Amendments were
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/1433" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >upstreamed to the MyST docs directly&lt;/a> and were immediately available to all.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/guide/quickstart-executable-documents" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tutorial on executable documents&lt;/a> was added to the collection of MyST tutorials.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>MyST-MD installation instructions were
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/pull/1454" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >simplified using &lt;code>mamba&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A bunch of enhancement features were requested ✨
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/issues/1455" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Using cell tags for labelling notebook cells&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/issues/321" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Support for loading user-defined CSS stylesheets for theming&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>

What is NeuroHackademy?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-is-neurohackademy">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Part summer school, part free-wheeling hackathon, all focused on the use of data science methods in neuroscience, NeuroHackademy is an event that was recently hosted by the
&lt;a href="http://escience.washington.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >University of Washington eScience Institute&lt;/a> in Seattle, WA, USA. This event, that has been running annually since 2016, aims to provide early-career researchers in Psychology, Medicine, Neuroscience, and other related fields with the skills and knowledge that they need to effectively and rigorously work with open source tools and workflows for analyzing human neuroscience data. This supports the effort to make scientific analysis and results shareable, reproducible, and accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="global-and-inclusive">
Global and inclusive
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#global-and-inclusive">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In 2020, the event had to rapidly pivot to an online format, and this format was also used in 2021. Through this experience, the organizers (
&lt;a href="https://arokem.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Ariel Rokem&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://nben.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Noah Benson&lt;/a>) realized that many participants preferred the online format. For example, participants who could not afford to travel to Seattle, or participants who had care-taking responsibilities that precluded them from participating in a two-week event away from their homes. In 2022, the event pioneered a hybrid format, where half of the participants are present in-person and half join the event via zoom, slack, GitHub, and of course through a dedicated 2i2c JupyterHub. Taken together, this format allows the participation of students from a larger range of backgrounds and locations. This aspect plays an important part in building a global and inclusive community of practice. See the paper
&lt;a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38763989/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Hands-On Neuroinformatics Education at the Crossroads of Online and In-Person: Lessons Learned from NeuroHackademy&lt;/a> to read more on this subject.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>NeuroHackademy has been an early adopter of the cloud-based JupyterHub model, setting up its first hub using the zero-to-jupyterhub guide in 2018. NeuroHackademy partnered with 2i2c as soon as it was founded, and 2i2c has operated a JupyterHub for the last 3 years. The hub provides an interactive computing platform for learners, and implements the &amp;ldquo;digital watering hole&amp;rdquo; for practical and immediate access to a range of cloud-based datasets in human neuroscience (see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/neurohackademy-summer-school/" >blog post&lt;/a> announcing support for this year&amp;rsquo;s event).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In terms of the software environment, the following tools and features that have benefited the event over the years include&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>nbgitpuller&lt;/code>&lt;/a> allows students to synchronise lesson content with an organizational GitHub repository that is collaboratively maintained by the lesson instructors.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/user/topics/data/sharing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Shared data file storage&lt;/a> with read-only access for learners and read-write access for instructors&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Access to an abundance of neuroimaging data hosted in cloud object storage

&lt;li>And more.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="this-year">
This year
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#this-year">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>This year 2i2c supported the following tools and features for NeuroHackademy&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &amp;ldquo;Bring your own image&amp;rdquo; option where users can pull any image hosted on a container registry into the hub. See our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" >Integrating BinderHub with JupyterHub: Empowering users to manage their own environments&lt;/a> blog post for more details.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>repo2docker&lt;/code>&lt;/a> and GitHub actions to build and prototype images from a repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The support services provided by 2i2c and the ability for instructors to
&lt;a href="https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/contributing/community-partner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >open pull requests on 2i2c infrastructure&lt;/a> for speedy resolution.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GPU instances to support more compute intensive workloads for machine learning.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h3 id="next-year">
Next year
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#next-year">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One thing we have learned is that 2i2c automatically
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/howto/control-user-server/#stop-user-servers-after-inactivity" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >shuts down a user server after one hour of inactivity&lt;/a> by default to ensure efficient resource usage and limit runaway cloud costs. Naturally, we are seeing increasing demand from learners for longer and more complex analyses. In response to this, we are keen to explore how the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/minrk/jupyter-keepalive" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyter-keepalive&lt;/code>&lt;/a> extension can keep the server alive for long-running processes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are pleased that learners have made great progress in making use of cloud-native, open-source workflows for analyzing human neuroscience data. We are keen to benefit from lessons learned this year and are looking forward to collaborating with 2i2c once again to deliver the NeuroHackademy Summer School in 2025.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Watch this space next year!&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://www.us-ocb.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Ocean Carbon and Biochemistry (OCB)&lt;/a> program, a one-week
&lt;a href="https://pacehackweek.github.io/pace-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >hackathon&lt;/a> ran from Aug 4 to Aug 8 on the 2i2c-hosted
&lt;a href="https://cryointhecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a> hub. The goal of the hackathon was to explore new Earth science data streams provided by the
&lt;a href="https://pace.oceansciences.org/oci.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >OCI&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://pace.oceansciences.org/spexone.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >SPEXone&lt;/a> and

Machine Learning with GPUs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#machine-learning-with-gpus">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>One of the most advanced tutorials delivered during the hackathon was the
&lt;a href="https://pacehackweek.github.io/pace-2024/presentations/hackweek/ml_cloud_mask.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Machine Learning Tutorial&lt;/a>. The tutorial focused on creating a machine learning pipeline to detect cloud cover from satellite imagery. This was done by training a convolutional neural network (CNN) to assign each pixel a binary value to indicate whether the location was covered by cloud or not. To improve the spatial context beyond a single pixel value, as the likelihood of a pixel containing cloud cover increases if its neighbours also contain cloud cover, the CNN needs to be trained on the entire image at once rather than at a single pixel level. This massively increases the training time, but also allows the CNN to learn more complex relationships between pixels.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>GPUs have a far greater number of cores than CPUs that are well-suited for accelerating the massive parallel processing needed to train a neural network on the large amounts of image data in the above scenario.
&lt;a href="https://pytorch.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PyTorch&lt;/a> is a popular Python library for training CNNs, available for both CPUs and GPUs, and is an ideal tool for performing this kind of work. In terms of the accelerator hardware available on the CryoCloud hub, 2i2c provisions an instance with an
&lt;a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/tesla-t4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU&lt;/a> with 4 CPUS, 16GB of RAM and 2,560 CUDA cores.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="managing-shared-memory-on-2i2c-hubs">
Managing shared memory on 2i2c hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#managing-shared-memory-on-2i2c-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While developing the above tutorial, tutorial lead Sean Foley (NASA/GSFC/SED &amp;amp; Morgan State University &amp;amp; GESTAR II) noticed that training neural networks was way slower than it should be given the GPUs available to them. They investigated the issue, and with help from the 2i2c engineering team, it was determined that shared memory was the issue. PyTorch uses shared memory via &lt;code>/dev/shm&lt;/code> for faster parallel processing, and maximizing use of GPU. However in containerized environments, this is limited to a maximum of 64MB by default.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="alert alert-note">
&lt;div>
&lt;p>You can check the amount of shared memory available on your hub in a terminal with the command&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>df -h | grep /dev/shm&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>
&lt;p>As you might expect, 64 MB of shared memory is not enough for training over 160,000 images in the tutorial. 2i2c was able to remove the limit, making &lt;code>/dev/shm&lt;/code> share the memory the user has selected via their profile list, rather than be artificially limited to any particular size. This was done for &lt;em>all&lt;/em> users on the CryoCloud hub within an hour of the issue being reported and we upstreamed the change for &lt;em>all&lt;/em> 2i2c hubs (see GitHub pull requests for
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/pull/4564" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/issues/4563" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >all 2i2c hubs&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>

Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>This event demonstrates the economy of how running shared and open infrastructure dynamically solves problems for the benefit of many users, not just for one occasion. Learning experiences such as the above are transferred and embedded upstream into transparent and flexible open source software that impacts not only all users of 2i2c operated hubs, but also generalized for the wider research community at large (case in point, see the Slack thread below from
&lt;a href="https://eeholmes.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Eli Holmes&lt;/a>, operator of the
&lt;a href="https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/science-data/open-science-noaa-fisheries" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NOAA Fisheries&lt;/a> hubs)! We are grateful for the strong partnerships with our communities who help us to co-design impactful solutions that are specific for their needs and accessible to all.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a>, following our previous work on launching the
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/" >US GHG center&lt;/a> (also see the
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/blog/2023-12-14-ghg-center" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed blog post&lt;/a>). Together with scientists at NASA in our regular sync touchpoints, we have recently delivered a tranche of improvements to
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This platform is designed to thread open-source components together to consolidate GIS delivery mechanisms, processing, analysis and visualization tools, and presented in a collaborative interactive computing environment. All code repositories and associated resources stemming from this work are available on the

the combined 2i2c and Development Seed team had for the last quarter. In this blog post, we will describe some of the significant ones!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="better-image-management-and-testing">

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker-action&lt;/a> is a GitHub action simplifying image building and testing for use with JupyterHub, using either a &lt;code>Dockerfile&lt;/code> or various
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration files&lt;/a> (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code>, &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>, etc) supported by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>. We migrated our image building pipeline from a somewhat homegrown solution to this upstream action, making image updates and testing &lt;em>much&lt;/em> easier. In particular, we can
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/pangeo-notebook-veda-image/pull/4" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >automatically run test notebooks&lt;/a> on every change we make to the image! This way, we can easily catch any breaking changes in library versions or other package installs without disrupting users. We also debugged and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker-action/pull/124" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >contributed upstream&lt;/a> fixes to the testing infrastructure so everyone could benefit from this, rather than just us.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">
Automatically pulling example notebooks on startup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#automatically-pulling-example-notebooks-on-startup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When a user logs into a JupyterHub, it is very helpful if we could have a bunch of example notebooks and other content pre-populated for them so they can get started right away.
&lt;a href="https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> is heavily used for this particular use case. However, it requires that nbgitpuller is installed inside the image the user is using - and not all images have it installed. In particular, we wanted to continue using the (wonderful)
&lt;a href="https://rocker-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Rocker images&lt;/a> maintained upstream for R users, however they do not have nbgitpuller installed. To solve this problem we built
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/jupyterhub-gitpuller-init" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-gitpuller-init&lt;/a>, which can be used as an
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/init-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >init container&lt;/a> to pre-populate user content on persistent home directories regardless of the image used. We also made sure to build this in a way that &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> can use it, and it is not tied into either 2i2c or VEDA infrastructure!&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/nasa-qgis-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >container image&lt;/a> that allows users to access large datasets stored in the cloud directly through QGIS on the JupyterHub, allowing users to work with much larger datasets than they could on their desktops by bringing cloud compute adjacent to the data. As a continuation of this work, we developed
&lt;a href="https://github.com/sunu/jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-qgis-proxy&lt;/a>, which builds QGIS specific features on top of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyter-remote-desktop-proxy&lt;/a>. In particular, it allows creation of shareable links that when clicked, opens specific datasets and layers in QGIS in a JupyterHub! You can see this in action:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Working closely with the 2i2c team on growing features to support users on the VEDA and GHG Center hubs has been absolutely amazing. With 2i2c’s deep experience in the Jupyter ecosystem, we have been able to implement some fairly complex features quite easily, and their strong open-source roots have ensured that whatever we work on is broadly useful to the wider Jupyter and scientific computing communities.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://openscapes.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Openscapes&lt;/a> is a value-based initiative that supports kinder, better science based on open source community.
&lt;a href="https://nasa-openscapes.github.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA Openscapes&lt;/a> is in its fourth year as a project supporting NASA Earth science in the Cloud, co-developed by Julia Lowndes (Openscapes) and Erin Robinson (Metadata Game Changers).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The initiative recently supported the

&lt;a href="https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Land Processes Distributed Activate Archive Center (LP DAAC)&lt;/a> and NASA
&lt;a href="https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL)&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instructors used the 2i2c Openscapes Hub to lead hands-on exercises teaching learners how to manipulate data collected from the
&lt;a href="https://ecostress.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ECOSTRESS&lt;/a> and

&lt;p>This event was attended by around 250 participants. An event of this size therefore requires a &lt;em>frictionless login flow&lt;/em> so that organizers could focus on the essential complexity of teaching data analysis rather than the accidental complexity of managing Hub authorization. GitHub authentication is the default option for most 2i2c Hubs for research use cases, but for an educational event of this size this option was not fit for purpose since organizers had to&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Retrieve the GitHub usernames of each participant (assuming everyone was familiar with GitHub!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually invite GitHub users to a GitHub organization to authorize access to the Hub (invitations would expire within seven days)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Repeat the above two steps last-minute for participants who showed up on the day without preparing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Manually remove GitHub users from the GitHub organization if they wanted to revoke access to the Hub after the event.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>In response to this need, we developed a shared password feature so that workshop organizers can simply hand the share password out to learners for access to the Hub. This bypassed the manual labour of managing GitHub accounts while not adding to the learner&amp;rsquo;s high cognitive load and improving the participant&amp;rsquo;s learning experience overall.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One of the elements that enabled us to recognize and solve this issue effectively is our close partnership with the Openscapes team. We engage in regular
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-Openscapes/2i2cAccessPolicies/issues/7" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >6-weekly catch-ups&lt;/a> where we can learn about user requirements and how we can develop our infrastructure to co-create optimal solutions. Together with our
&lt;a href="https://team-compass.2i2c.org/product/deliveryflow/#defining-our-product-delivery-flow" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Product Delivery Flow&lt;/a>, we were quickly able to architect the shared password solution in time for the workshop.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Spyglass&lt;/a> is a framework for reproducible and shareable neuroscience research produced by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/LorenFrankLab" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Loren Frank’s lab&lt;/a> at the University of California, San Francisco. Check out our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/hhmi-spyglass/" >blog post about the release of their preprint&lt;/a> to read more about the methods.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This post focuses on the complex data storage needed for the project, which can be difficult to set up locally or at scale in the cloud. In particular, the analysis needed a MySQL database for reproducibility. This is a fairly common task across many fields. The aim of 2i2c is to enable researchers to focus on the essential complexity of what they were doing, i.e. the science, without managing the accidental complexity of how to do it &amp;ndash; in this case, setting up databases.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We describe how you can do this too for your own JupyterHubs. Since 2i2c commits to running our infrastructure in line with open-source values as much as possible, you can also directly see the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/99071c38712ef8e6bed6609117ca4b894b89ae5c/config/clusters/hhmi/spyglass.values.yaml#L76" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration for the hub&lt;/a> referenced in the paper.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Kubernetes definition of a
&lt;a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/sidecar-containers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >sidecar container&lt;/a> is&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Sidecar containers are the secondary containers that run along with the main application container within the same Pod. These containers are used to enhance or to extend the functionality of the primary app container by providing additional services, or functionality such as logging, monitoring, security, or data synchronization, without directly altering the primary application code.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>In this case, the &lt;em>primary&lt;/em> app container is the JupyterLab instance where people are interactively running code and doing science. We want to provide a MySQL database as a sidecar so that each user server gets their own independent MySQL server instance (that is not accessible to anyone else). We can then run code such as&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">%%bash
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -u root --password=tutorial &amp;lt; path-to-sql-file-with-data
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/div>&lt;p>to load data into the database. Note the IP address &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code> - the MySQL server is listening on localhost, even though it is not running in the &lt;em>same container&lt;/em>! Thanks to the magic of
&lt;a href="https://lwn.net/Articles/580893/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Linux Network Namespaces&lt;/a>, the sidecar and main app container can share &lt;code>127.0.0.1&lt;/code>. This allows you to write code that works &lt;strong>in the exact same way&lt;/strong> on a user&amp;rsquo;s local computers as on the JupyterHub, making transitions and replication easier.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-did-we-do">
What did we do?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-did-we-do">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As part of the deliverables for our NASA High Priority Open-Source Science (HPOSS) award, we deployed two new ephemeral hubs:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>a
&lt;a href="https://binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >public small BinderHub&lt;/a> that offers a &amp;ldquo;reader&amp;rdquo; experience where learners can interactively view GitHub repositories that deliver light scientific content with small compute and no barriers to authentication&lt;/li>
&lt;li>a
&lt;a href="https://hub.big.binder.opensci.2i2c.cloud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >big BinderHub&lt;/a> that offers an &amp;ldquo;explorer&amp;rdquo; experience where learners can log in to access more substantial compute resources to interactively investigate large datasets and run large workflows from any GitHub repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>These services enrich the interactive computing ecosystem for NASA communities by&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>improving the shareability and reproducibility of scientific information&lt;/li>
&lt;li>broadening participation for historically excluded and under-resourced science communities&lt;/li>
&lt;li>enabling activities such as hackathons, demonstrations or training, during workshops and conferences.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="how-did-we-do-it">
How did we do it?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-we-do-it">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ephemeral interactive computing services benefited from some of our previous development work in collaboration with GESIS (see our
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/" >detailed blog post&lt;/a> for more information). The research and development of this project achieved wide-reaching impact across many NASA communities we currently serve, including

&lt;a href="https://cryointhecloud.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CryoCloud&lt;/a>; as well as networks beyond the NASA scope, such as the NSF-funded
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia&lt;/a> and HHMI-funded
&lt;a href="https://lorenfranklab.github.io/spyglass/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Spyglass&lt;/a> projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-next">
What next?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-next">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We will focus on bolstering the community- and knowledge-building needed for making the best use of these binder services in the next phase of our HPOSS work to accelerate broader participation in science. This includes opportunities such as running workshops and tutorials, as well as disseminating best practices for collaborative research. Further engineering developments will proceed in collaboration with the NASA VEDA project to set up a binder service, improve the sharing of custom environments, and refine QGIS integrations for analysing geospatial data.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="can-i-use-this-ephemeral-hub-service">
Can I use this ephemeral hub service?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#can-i-use-this-ephemeral-hub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The answer is yes!&lt;/p>

&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere (
&lt;a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CIRA&lt;/a>) is an interdisciplinary cooperation between NOAA research scientists and Colorado State University. CIRA is hosting a
&lt;a href="https://www.cira.colostate.edu/conferences/rmtgw/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >summer school&lt;/a> for inverse modeling of greenhouse gases using atmospheric data assimilation techniques. The
&lt;a href="https://earth.gov/ghgcenter" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >US Greenhouse Gas Center&lt;/a> is supporting the workshop by providing 40+ attendees access to their interactive computing hub operated by 2i2c (see
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/" >our blog post about their launch&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hub administrators have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/ssim-ghg-workshop-2024-python-image" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >built a customized software environment&lt;/a> with container technology for use at the workshop. In doing so, this bypasses the need for participants to individually install software on their own machines and the online hub provides a &lt;em>consistent&lt;/em> and &lt;em>reproducible&lt;/em> interactive computing environment that is easily &lt;em>accessible&lt;/em> and &lt;em>scalable&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia&lt;/a> is the education working group for
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a>, a community platform for Big Data geoscience in which 2i2c operates a cloud hub. The core aim of Project Pythia is to spearhead the creation and curation of community-driven, open-source documentation, in the form of &amp;ldquo;cookbooks&amp;rdquo;, to enable the adoption of &lt;em>open&lt;/em>, &lt;em>scalable&lt;/em> and &lt;em>reproducible&lt;/em> workflows for geoscientists.&lt;/p>

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Jenny, James and Angus from the 2i2c team participated in the annual
&lt;a href="https://projectpythia.org/pythia-cookoff-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Project Pythia Cook-off 2024&lt;/a>, a hackathon where cookbook authors and collaborators can spend dedicated time on creating and maintaining their content using

Day 1
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#day-1">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>2i2c deployed and demonstrated a dedicated BinderHub service for Project Pythia that allowed hackathon participants to &amp;ldquo;self-serve&amp;rdquo; images of their software environment, which were specified by including a list of packages in an &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> file placed in their GitHub cookbook repository. Participants could then pull the image from a container registry into their 2i2c hub (or indeed, any other JupyterHub server) to share and reproduce their computational environments with ease.&lt;/p>

Day 2
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#day-2">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>During the first half of the day, we quickly identified a number of issues that were proving to be a maintenance headache for the Project Pythia infrastructure group:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Configuration files for each cookbook were difficult to update at scale. Project Pythia currently have a gallery of over 30 cookbooks!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Changes to Sphinx-based themes inherited from upstream were prone to breaking custom Project Pythia branding downstream.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Executable content was not able to run on the Project Pythia&amp;rsquo;s dedicated BinderHub hosted on
&lt;a href="https://jetstream-cloud.org/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JetStream2&lt;/a> (operated by NSF).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Cookbooks frequently cross-referenced materials from other cookbooks to build upon pre-existing knowledge, but this was not easy to author and the reader experience was not as smooth as it could be.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Following the announcement that
&lt;a href="" >Jupyter Book 2.0 will use MyST&lt;/a> last month, Rowan (Curvenote) and Angus (2i2c) delivered a compelling demonstration of the
&lt;a href="https://mystmd.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >MyST&lt;/a> ecosystem centered around modern web-first technologies (JavaScript/TypeScript) that offers improved interactivity and accessibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the second half of the day, we decided to use the hackathon to explore migrating the Pythia cookbooks from using a Sphinx-based to a MyST-based document structure and engine. Within one afternoon, the group migrated four cookbooks to use MyST MD&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>

&lt;/ol>

&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This moment was palpably exciting! It was evident that MyST MD supported backwards compatible content out of the box, which alleviated fears of sunk cost into existing Sphinx-based cookbooks. The migration workflow was as simple as executing the following commands&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>conda install mystmd&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>myst&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

Day 4
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#day-4">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Looking to the future, we spent time reflecting on our experiences and discussing the potential, transformative impact MyST MD tooling could have in the hands of the scientific community at large, including the communities served by 2i2c. Knowledge-sharing based on static figures and PDFs would fall obsolete and give way to a dynamic, web-first approach to sharing interactive narratives backed by compute from a Jupyter server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Throughout the course of the hackathon, the rate of iterated development for both end users of the community cookbook and the developers of the open-source tooling was astounding. For example, we were able to quickly expose small bugs (
&lt;a href="https://github.com/executablebooks/mystmd/issues/1297" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >e.g. support for HTML video tags&lt;/a>) in the MyST MD tooling, which were immediately fixed upstream and released within minutes. The feedback loop that connected the user experience with the software tooling was incredibly synergistic, with immediate impact both upstream and downstream that 2i2c hopes to continue replicating across many facets of their operations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Beyond the Project Pythia Cook-off, the breakout group will continue conversations around strengthening their community of practice and hopefully advocating for wider adoption of MyST MD amongst the scientific community (say hello to some of our group members at
&lt;a href="https://www.scipy2024.scipy.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >SciPy 2024&lt;/a> in July!).&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="what-happened">
What happened?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happened">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, the JupyterHub team discovered a security vulnerability in
&lt;a href="https://jupyter-server-proxy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> package&lt;/a> that would allow potential unauthenticated access to a JupyterHub via WebSockets, allowing unauthenticated users to run arbitrary code on the JupyterHub.
&lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code> is used by many communities to provide alternative user interfaces like RStudio and remote desktops.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This vulnerability was detected by the JupyterHub team, with leadership from 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers. It was resolved through upstream contributions to the JupyterHub project, and we have deployed a fix that mitigates this vulnerability for all the hubs 2i2c manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="does-this-impact-my-2i2c-community-hub">
Does this impact my 2i2c community hub?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#does-this-impact-my-2i2c-community-hub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We do not believe that any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities were impacted by this vulnerability, and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/f86d128a0d045163e72802f6df287a6f46d4b738/helm-charts/basehub/values.yaml#L296" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >a patch&lt;/a> has now been pushed to all community hubs to resolve this issue.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If your community was vulnerable to this problem, you might experience slightly slower startup latency while we work out a long-term solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since this is a vulnerability in the docker image used by our communities, we will be reaching out over the next few weeks to put a more permanent fix in place.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re grateful that the JupyterHub community was quick to acknowledge, respond, and resolve this security vulnerability after it was brought to their attention.
We&amp;rsquo;re also proud that 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s engineers helped the JupyterHub team throughout the process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This allowed our team to resolve the problem before it impacted any of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s communities.
Because 2i2c community infrastructure is managed in a central location, we were able to resolve this for over 80 communities with a single team rather than expecting each community to learn about and fix this problem on their own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also believe this reflects the healthy upstream relationships that we hope to encourage with our team&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Open Source strategy and practices&lt;/a>.
By working with the JupyterHub community and pushing changes upstream, we&amp;rsquo;ve resolved this issue for &lt;em>any&lt;/em> user of &lt;code>jupyter-server-proxy&lt;/code>, not just 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s own ecosystem.
In particular, because of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s position running hubs for many communities via Kubernetes, we were able to identify a solution that did not require every user image to be updated (as described in section &lt;strong>For JupyterHub admins of Z2JH installations&lt;/strong>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We believe that all of these lead to a healthier, safer ecosystem of open source tools ❤️.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integrating BinderHub with JupyterHub: Empowering users to manage their own environments</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Jan 2024 16:56:14 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/jupyterhub-binderhub-gesis/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>Thanks to

&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> is a very popular service that allows end users to specify and share the environment (languages, packages, etc) required for their notebooks to run correctly by placing
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#config-files" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >configuration files&lt;/a> they are already familiar with (like &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> or &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>) along with their notebooks. While not without its own set of challenges, this is extremely powerful because it puts control of the &lt;em>environment&lt;/em> in the hands of the people who write the code. They can customize the environment to fit the needs of their code, instead of having to fit their code into the environment that admins have made available.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>But, mybinder.org (and the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a> software that powers it) is built for &lt;em>sharing&lt;/em> your work after you are done with it, &lt;em>not&lt;/em> for actively doing work. BinderHubs often do not have persistent storage nor persistent user identity, and UX is centered around &lt;em>ephemeral&lt;/em> interactivity that can be shared with others (via a link), rather than &lt;em>persistent&lt;/em> interactivity that a single user repeatedly comes back to.
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub&lt;/a> is more commonly used for this kinda workflow, but doesn&amp;rsquo;t currently have the ability for users to easily build their own environments. Admins who are &lt;em>running&lt;/em> the JupyterHub can make
&lt;a href="https://z2jh.jupyter.org/en/stable/jupyterhub/customizing/user-environment.html#using-multiple-profiles-to-let-users-select-their-environment" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >multiple environments&lt;/a> available for users to choose from, but this still puts admins in the critical path for environment customization.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CESSDA&lt;/a>, aims to bring this flexibility to JupyterHub directly. We aim to empower users to decide for themselves which applications and dependencies are installed on a per-project basis. Our work enables communities with heterogeneous requirements to share a single Hub. Our approach frees administrators from being overwhelmed by installation requests and transforms the JupyterHub platform into a platform for collaborative computational reproducibility. In this update, we report on our progress and upcoming steps in this project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">
What does a BinderHub do, exactly?
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#what-does-a-binderhub-do-exactly">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It is helpful to understand that BinderHub primarily has 3 responsibilities:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Present a UI to the end user for them to provide details on what to build (this is what you see when you go to mybinder.org)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Call out to
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a> in a scalable way to actually &lt;em>build and push&lt;/em> an image containing the environment for the given repository, and show the user logs as this build process happens. This also allows users to debug issues with their build more easily.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Talk to a JupyterHub instance to launch a user server with the built docker image, and redirect the user to this.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>(2) is really the &lt;em>core&lt;/em> feature of BinderHub, and we settled on figuring out how to make that available to JupyterHub users. It was really important to us that this was also done in a way that can be sustainably used by &lt;em>everyone&lt;/em>, not just 2i2c. This blog post discusses the various improvements to the broad ecosystem of projects in the Jupyter ecosystem to get this done.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="demo">
Demo
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#demo">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>But first, a very quick demo of how this looks like right now now!&lt;/p>
&lt;!-- generated from original .mov screen recording with `ffmpeg -i screencast.mov -c:v libx264 screencast.mp4` -->
&lt;p>&lt;video src="./screencast.mp4" autoplay muted controls>&lt;/video>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is very much a work in progress, but the basic flow can be seen clearly. Users see a Server Options menu after they log into JupyterHub. They can specify the two primary things that determine the server configuration:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The resources allocated (RAM, CPU and maybe GPU)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>The environment (container image) used, which can be specified in one of 3 ways:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>a. A pre-selected list of environments (container images), provided by the administrators who set up this JupyterHub
b. A blank text box where you can enter any publicly available docker image they want
c. A mybinder.org style way to specify a GitHub repository, which will be then dynamically built into a docker image for the user!&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>So what did we need to do to accomplish this, in a way that&amp;rsquo;s very upstream friendly and usable by everyone (and not just 2i2c)?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">
A Standalone &lt;code>binderhub-service&lt;/code> helm chart
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#a-standalone-binderhub-service-helm-chart">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The default upstream
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/tree/main/helm-chart" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a> &lt;em>includes&lt;/em> a JupyterHub as a dependency, and configures itself to be used primarily in a manner similar to
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a>. As the person who helped make that choice early on, I can tell you why it was made - for convenience! And it &lt;em>was&lt;/em> very convenient, as it allowed us to get mybinder.org going fast. However, it makes it difficult to install a BinderHub service &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub. To this end, we have created a standalone
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/binderhub-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub helm chart&lt;/a>, designed to be installed &lt;em>alongside&lt;/em> an existing JupyterHub, so we can use it &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> to build images. This allows the BinderHub instance to be used as a
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Service&lt;/a>, which is what we want.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While this helm chart is currently under the 2i2c GitHub org, the hope is that it can eventually migrate to a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/team-compass/issues/519" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-contrib&lt;/a> organization (once it is created), or it can become the upstream helm chart for BinderHub if enough work can be done in BinderHub to allow it to serve use cases like mybinder.org.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this work, we also added a way for BinderHub to run in
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1647" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >API only mode&lt;/a>, so we can fully turn off the UI &lt;em>and&lt;/em> launching ability of BinderHub. This change decoupled the
&lt;a href="" >three responsibilities of BinderHub&lt;/a> we discussed previously, allowing us to bring our own UI and JupyterHub. BinderHub could now be used &lt;em>purely&lt;/em> for its scalable image building features, which is exactly what we want!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">
Sustainably extending KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#sustainably-extending-kubespawners-profilelist">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We identified KubeSpawner&amp;rsquo;s &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> feature as the ideal location for UI to dynamically build environments (container images), making it just another &amp;rsquo;environment choice&amp;rsquo; people can choose, along with picking the resources their server needs. From an end-user perspective, it was also the logical place for them to specify a repository to build into an environment, as they could already choose some pre-built environments from here. They can also select other arbitrary resources they want (such as memory, GPU, etc) from here as well. From a maintainer perspective, it helps with long-term maintenance of the JupyterHub projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The implementation of &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> however, was not easy to extend at this point. So
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/724" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this PR&lt;/a> improved how easy it was to extend it in more complex ways, without making the implementation in KubeSpawner itself complicated. Even though this had &lt;em>no&lt;/em> visible end-user effects, it was an extremely important step in allowing us to experiment with UI in a &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> way without having to rely on upstream. These kinds of changes can sometimes be hard to sell to stakeholders but are extremely important in ensuring a continuous and sustainable relationship with upstream.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">
Implementing &lt;code>unlisted_choice&lt;/code> feature in KubeSpawner
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#implementing-unlisted_choice-feature-in-kubespawner">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The profileList feature was built to allow JupyterHub &lt;em>admins&lt;/em> to specify an explicit list of container images the end-user can choose from. It did not have a way for any choice that was &lt;em>not&lt;/em> pre-approved by the admin to be used. We needed this feature since the BinderHub API will build a new docker image for each environment the user wants, and so this can not be chosen from a pre-approved list. We had to safely add this feature to KubeSpawner in such a way that it was generally useful to everyone. Many other communities had been asking for such a feature anyway - the ability to simply &amp;rsquo;type in&amp;rsquo; an image and have that be used.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA VEDA&lt;/a> was one such community, so we partnered with
&lt;a href="https://github.com/batpad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sanjay Bhangar&lt;/a> from
&lt;a href="https://developmentseed.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Development Seed&lt;/a> (an organization that helps run NASA VEDA) to implement this feature. Engineers from 2i2c contributed heavily to this feature as well, and after &lt;em>several&lt;/em> PRs (
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/735" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >1&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/766" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/773" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >3&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/774" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >4&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/kubespawner/pull/777" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >5&lt;/a>), this feature is now available for everyone to use!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>

&lt;div class="w-100" >&lt;img src="./screenshot-featured.png" alt="Screenshot of Kubernetes Profiles with Unlisted Choice" loading="lazy" data-zoomable />&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;/figure>
&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A key component of doing &lt;em>sustainable&lt;/em> upstream work is that every addition needs to be useful by itself for a broad group of people. This change was very helpful for many communities that wanted to allow their users the freedom to pick whatever image they want to use, regardless of wether they wanted to use dynamic image building or not. The broad interest allowed us to build a coalition with other interested parties, and get the change accepted upstream more easily!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhub-fancy-profiles">
&lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhub-fancy-profiles">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once we had all these pieces in place, it was time to actually work on the frontend UI that would allow users to build images dynamically and launch them. Since this will replace the &amp;lsquo;profileList&amp;rsquo; feature, it should also allow them to select different resources (RAM, CPU, etc) as needed, as well as type in an existing image if they desire. So it was a full re-implementation of the &lt;code>profileList&lt;/code> frontend.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is ongoing now at the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-fancy-profiles" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/a> project. It is a pure frontend web application, using modern frontend tooling (
&lt;a href="https://react.dev/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >React&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://webpack.js.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >webpack&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://babeljs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Babel&lt;/a>, etc) and written in JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s gone through a few revisions, but the demo provided earlier in the blog post is in its current state. Because the default profileList implementation is pure HTML / CSS with very &lt;em>minimal&lt;/em> JS, it is limited in what kind of UX it could have. &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> aims to be very helpful &lt;em>even&lt;/em> when dynamic image-building features are not enabled on a JupyterHub. We hope to roll this out to a few JupyterHubs and improve it over time based on feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterhub/binderhub-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub/@binderhub-client&lt;/code>&lt;/a> npm package
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#jupyterhubbinderhub-clienthttpswwwnpmjscompackagejupyterhubbinderhub-client-npm-package">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While building &lt;code>jupyterhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code>, we wanted to use the &lt;em>same&lt;/em> javascript code used by BinderHub frontend to interact with the BinderHub API, instead of re-implementing it. However, the existing BinderHub JavaScript code was not easily consumable by external projects. We refactored the code, added tests, migrated to use modern JS practices and published the
&lt;a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jupyterhub/binderhub-client" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>jupyterhub/@binderhub-client&lt;/code> NPM package&lt;/a> that can be used not just by &lt;code>jupyerhub-fancy-profiles&lt;/code> but any external project for talking to the BinderHub API.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This had to be done in such a way that current BinderHub installations (such as mybinder.org) do not break. That took quite a few pull requests:
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1689" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >1&lt;/a>,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/binderhub/pull/1693" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2&lt;/a>,

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For Open Science to flourish, we need to allow access to resources without login / paywalls wherever possible. A new menace against this has been
&lt;a href="https://www.interpol.int/en/Crimes/Cybercrime/Cryptojacking" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cryptojacking&lt;/a> - where attackers use up any and all available free compute to mine cryptocurrencies. This has affected &lt;em>many&lt;/em> folks on the internet, including
&lt;a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-actions-being-actively-abused-to-mine-cryptocurrency-on-github-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GitHub Actions&lt;/a> and mybinder.org, the primary public BinderHub installation. mybinder.org has some extra protections against cryptojacking that aren&amp;rsquo;t easily usable elsewhere, and this has unfortunately meant that the demo JupyterHubs we have with these features enabled have been behind a login wall. I personally believe login walls are long term antithetical to open science, and so this was an important problem to solve.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/cryptnono/cryptnono" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cryptnono&lt;/a> is an open source project designed to help fight cryptojacking, and as part of this grant we ported some of this functionality out of mybinder.org specific code into cryptnono, so other deployments may also benefit from it! We also migrated to using the super efficient
&lt;a href="https://ebpf.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ebpf&lt;/a> Linux Kernel subsystem, allowing for more complex heuristics to catch a much broader range of cryptomining activity. We have been slowly tweaking the config on mybinder.org, and it has proven to be very effective! This will be very helpful for &lt;em>anyone&lt;/em> who wants to provide a JupyterHub (or any other computational service) without a login wall. If you are interested in using cryptnono in this fashion, please

&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideRatio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker-service&lt;/a>, a separate JupyterHub service that could &lt;em>only&lt;/em> build images. As we worked on it, we realized that it was replicating a lot of features that BinderHub already has, so we pivoted to working on BinderHub directly instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Building off of
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a>. While this already had a nice UI, it would be hard to port it to run on a distributed Kubernetes environment without it becoming a &amp;lsquo;hard fork&amp;rsquo;.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>While these did slow down the implementation of the project, it has allowed us to be very confident that the methods we have chosen are long-term sustainable.&lt;/p>

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>mybinder.org also helps you distribute your &lt;em>content&lt;/em>, not just the environment for your code to run in. Since JupyterHub usually comes with a persistent home directory for the user,
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/nbgitpuller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >nbgitpuller&lt;/a> is commonly used for this purpose instead. We should explore ways to integrate nbgitpuller (and other ways to distribute content) in the future.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>More thorough documentation for how you can recreate what is in the demo for yourself in your own JupyterHub installation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better UX for specifying images, including figuring out how to &amp;lsquo;save&amp;rsquo; them for future reuse.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better compatibility with mybinder.org, particularly in allowing other sources of environments (not just GitHub, but Zenodo, raw git repositories, etc) and URL compatibility.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Better authentication workflow between the frontend and the BinderHub API.&lt;/li>

Scientific Context

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It was controversial in 1827 when Joseph Fourier (the discoverer of the
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermal_conduction#Fourier%27s_law" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >law of heat conduction&lt;/a>) argued &lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> that the atmosphere keeps the Earth warm, like a puffy down comforter, but it&amp;rsquo;s not now. Gases in the atmosphere trap heat near Earth. How much heat is trapped depends on the gas mixture. Putting more heat-trapping gases in is like putting a wool blanket on top of the down comforter. Human activity since industrialization is injecting lots more heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere and changing the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The science is clear. The up-to-date consensus view of the global scientific community is expressed in the
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/assessment-report/ar6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Sixth Assessment Report&lt;/a> of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC):&lt;/p>

A glossary of acronyms and additional background:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>The First World Climate Conference (&lt;strong>WCC-1&lt;/strong>) &lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> was held in 1979.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The World Climate Programme (
&lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en/programmes/world-climate-programme" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >WCP&lt;/a>), an activity overseen by the
&lt;a href="https://public.wmo.int/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >World Meteorological Organization&lt;/a> was established after WCC-1. WCP, in partnership with other organizations, operates programs (e.g. the
&lt;a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >World Climate Research Program (WCRP)&lt;/a>) that organize and integrate international scientific efforts to understand the climate. The WMO also operates the
&lt;a href="https://ig3is.wmo.int/en/who-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Integrated Global Greenhouse Gas Information System (IG3IS)&lt;/a>, a natural partner for the emerging work described below.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>WCRP manages the
&lt;a href="https://wcrp-cmip.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Common Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP)&lt;/a>. CMIP serves as a kind of &lt;strong>league for intercomparing models&lt;/strong> of the Earth&amp;rsquo;s climate system developed by teams who approach the problems with different methods and designs. Intercomparison, an approach that enables finding the consensus views of teams with divergent approaches to problems, is used in other modeling scenarios.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research papers on the climate are rapidly produced by scholars from essentially all knowledge disciplines. This overwhelming stream of content, like snowflakes in a blizzard, is coalesced into coherent and carefully scrutinized &lt;strong>
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/reports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >IPCC Assessment Reports&lt;/a>&lt;/strong> by the
&lt;a href="https://www.ipcc.ch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Summit" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Earth Summit&lt;/a> held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992 led to the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC)&lt;/a>. The UNFCCC is an international treaty that recognizes the dangers to the climate system caused by human activity, calls for ongoing study, and establishes recurring
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process/bodies/supreme-bodies/conference-of-the-parties-cop" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Conference of the Parties (COP)&lt;/a> meetings.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/event/cop-3" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-3 (Kyoto)&lt;/a> led to the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Kyoto Protocol Treaty&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byrd%E2%80%93Hagel_Resolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Byrd-Hagel Resolution&lt;/a> was a unanimous United States Senate Resolution that stipulated the United States would not sign treaties promising greenhouse gas reductions by developed countries that did not mandate similar reductions from developing countries. This killed USA participation in the Kyoto Protocol Treaty.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Paris Agreement&lt;/a>, established at
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/event/cop-21" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-21 (Paris)&lt;/a>, effectively replaces the Kyoto Protocol, includes specifications by participant countries on greenhouse gas reductions called &lt;em>National Determined Contributions&lt;/em> (NDCs). The United States entered the Paris Agreement under President Obama, exited under President Trump and rejoined under President Biden.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;a href="https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/cop26" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >COP-26 (Glasgow)&lt;/a>established an accountability system for the Paris Agreement called the
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/FAQ-moving-towards-the-ETF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF)&lt;/a>. Participant countries to the Paris Agreement will
&lt;a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/transparency-and-reporting/preparing-for-the-ETF" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >submit their first Biennial Transparency Reports (BTR1) under the ETF&lt;/a> in 2024.&lt;/li>

&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/inventory-us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-and-sinks" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) annually releases&lt;/a> the &lt;em>Inventory of U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks&lt;/em> reports. These reports are submitted to the United Nations in accordance with the UNFCCC. The EPA
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/greenhouse-gas-inventory-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >openly shares&lt;/a> software, tools, data, and
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/capacity-building-national-greenhouse-gas-inventories" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >builds capacity&lt;/a> to assist other nations to assemble their own greenhouse gas inventories.&lt;/p>

The IWG, renamed as the
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/sc_co2_tsd_august_2016.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Interagency Working Group on Social Cost of Greenhouse Gases in 2016&lt;/a>, synthesizes research on
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_assessment_modelling" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >integrated assessment modelling&lt;/a> to quantify the dollar costs associated to damage caused by an incremental increase in GHG emissions in a given year. Quantifying the impacts of GHG emissions in monetary terms is vital to effective rulemaking across the Federal Government. This
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2016-12/documents/social_cost_of_carbon_fact_sheet.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >EPA fact sheet on the social costs of carbon&lt;/a> provides further background. A 2017 consensus report &lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> of the National Academies of Science Engineering and Medicine (NASEM) offered recommendations for ongoing research to improve the assignment of social costs to GHG emissions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other federal agencies have developed expertise, data, and analyses that give insights into GHG emissions that compliment and potentially extend the &lt;em>Inventory&lt;/em> reports developed annually by the EPA. How should the United States integrate federal agency efforts to monitor and measure greenhouse gas emissions? A 2022 NASEM consensus report &lt;sup id="fnref:6">&lt;a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> investigated this question. In January of this year, the
&lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/ceq/news-updates/2023/01/06/biden-harris-administration-releases-new-guidance-to-disclose-climate-impacts-in-environmental-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Biden Administration&lt;/a> released guidance&lt;sup id="fnref:7">&lt;a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> for federal agencies on incorporating GHG emissions information in policies and reports. Shortly thereafter, a draft federal strategy to advance an integrated greenhouse gas monitoring system was
&lt;a href="https://nspires.nasaprs.com/external/solicitations/summary.do?solId=%7bDDD1BC85-9276-8FB7-C362-A00E3E427E0D%7d&amp;amp;path=&amp;amp;method=init" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >released by NASA with a request for public input&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some important insights from the NASEM consensus report, the draft federal strategy, and the IWG reports:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Data streams on greenhouse gas emissions can be sorted into two broad categories:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Activity-based:&lt;/strong> Activity-based data, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;bottom-up&amp;rdquo; data, quantify GHG emissions by measuring activities that generate GHG emissions. Economic or business activity data (gallons of diesel sold in a county on Tuesday; miles flown by a 747 in October) can be converted into quantified GHG emissions information.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Atmospheric-based:&lt;/strong> Atmosphere-based data, sometimes called &amp;ldquo;top-down&amp;rdquo; data, quantify GHG emissions by performing atmospheric measurements. For example, the
&lt;a href="https://ocov2.jpl.nasa.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO2)&lt;/a> remotely senses $CO_2$ from space.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A hybrid approach that blends activity-based and atmospheric-based GHG data has the potential to provide new insights.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Interoperable and easily accessed tools and data products for analyzing GHG emissions information and assigning costs should be made available across the Federal government.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>GHG emissions information is needed in scenarios outside the international context of participating nations reporting for UNFCCC and Paris Agreement ETF compliance:
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Subnational governments&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; cities, states, provinces, counties &amp;ndash; want GHG data products to measure their progress on emission reduction programs.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Facilities&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; harbours, toll roads, power plants, factories, universities &amp;ndash; similarly want GHG data products.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Companies&lt;/strong> &amp;ndash; airlines, trucking, construction &amp;ndash; want GHG data products.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Reliable and transparent GHG emissions information is required to enable effective environmental-social-governance (ESG) investment without “greenwashing”.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Accurate and improving quantifications of the social costs associated to GHG emissions require ongoing research.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;p>How much GHG emission is generated through oil and gas production? How much GHG emission is generated by urban centers? Do landfills contribute significant GHG emissions? How do human-generated GHG emissions compare to natural sources of GHG emissions? The U.S. GHG Center is designed to assemble the data, tools, and people to scientifically address these kinds of questions.&lt;/p>

Openness: Amplified Knowledge Sharing
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#openness-amplified-knowledge-sharing">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center builds on
&lt;a href="https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/greenhouse-gas-inventory-tools" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >EPA&amp;rsquo;s leadership to openly share the data and tools for the &lt;em>Inventory&lt;/em>&lt;/a>and the

Instead of building a walled garden with proprietary technology from a vendor selected through RFP, the Center launched a prototype platform using curated open source tools integrated with public federal data. This &lt;strong>open toolchain approach&lt;/strong> amplifies the open data efforts developed over the past two decades.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The U.S. GHG Center&amp;rsquo;s interactive computing platform is &lt;strong>open source science infrastructure&lt;/strong>. The platform is:&lt;/p>

&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Research, data and recommendations developed by scientists and engineers that influence policies set by democratic governments should be accessible by voters. No entity should own the ways humans communicate and learn about the Earth system. The U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center&amp;rsquo;s generous approach to digital infrastructure &amp;ndash; an open toolchain adjacent to open data &amp;ndash; is vital for democracy and should be replicated across government agencies worldwide.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Docker Stacks&lt;/a> project provides a collection of ready-to-use Docker images for Jupyter environments. These images are used by many in the Jupyter community, including 2i2c which uses them as base images for our JupyterHub deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The project recently began publishing
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyter/docker-stacks/issues/1019" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >ARM-compatible images&lt;/a> alongside the standard x86 images, making it easier for users with ARM-based systems (like M1 Macs) to use these environments. However, building and hosting these ARM images comes with additional cloud computing costs that were being personally covered by
&lt;a href="https://github.com/mathbunnyru" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >@mathbunnyru&lt;/a>, one of the project&amp;rsquo;s maintainers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A part of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s mission is supporting upstream communities that we rely on, especially where the upstream project has limited resources. For this reason, we&amp;rsquo;ve decided to support Jupyter Docker Stack&amp;rsquo;s ARM building costs, with a total budget of &lt;code>$2000&lt;/code> (approximately &lt;code>$150&lt;/code> per month). As a regular user and beneficiary of the Jupyter Docker Stacks, we believe it&amp;rsquo;s important to contribute to the maintenance and sustainability of this crucial piece of infrastructure that benefits the entire Jupyter community.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We hope this support helps the Docker Stacks project remain healthy, and continue providing high-quality, multi-architecture images that work across different computing platforms. We&amp;rsquo;ll revisit this decision as the landscape of technology providers changes and other options arise.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>UNITEFA forms the first community of the Catalyst Project at UNC, through the CCAD (in Spanish)</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/external-unitefa-catalyst/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Oct 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/external-unitefa-catalyst/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A QGIS desktop in the cloud with JupyterHub</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/qgis-greenland/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/qgis-greenland/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;p>JupyterHub is a versatile platform that can serve a desktop with Geospatial Information Systems (GIS) software in the cloud. This was demonstrated by the QGreenland Researcher Workshop that was hosted by the NASA CryoCloud hub. The hands-on workshop trained 25-30 researchers, from Germany, India, France, Canada, Poland and the United States, on how to work with geospatial data in an open science framework.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="qgreenland-overview">
QGreenland Overview
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#qgreenland-overview">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://qgreenland.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QGreenland&lt;/a> is an open-source geospatial data package designed for QGIS, a community-owned GIS platform. It focuses on Greenland, offering researchers and educators a comprehensive toolset for FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reproducible) data analysis. The package integrates a variety of datasets into a single, easy-to-use data-viewing and analysis platform, supporting both offline and online use. This makes it particularly valuable for remote fieldwork and areas with limited internet access.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="workshop-success">
Workshop Success
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#workshop-success">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The QGreenland workshop demonstrated several key benefits of using JupyterHub for cloud-based GIS:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Accessibility: Participants from across the world could access the same powerful GIS tools through a web browser, eliminating the need for complex local installations while enhancing reproducibility&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cloud block storage: Using a JupyterHub in the cloud allowed for faster data access than a traditional NFS file store by provisioning each user with an elastic block store disk, reducing load times from 5 minutes to under 3 seconds.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Cost Efficiency: Utilizing the CryoCloud JupyterHub instance managed by 2i2c drastically cut down setup costs and time, with only minimal cloud operating expenses of roughly $1/person/day.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">
Conclusion
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#conclusion">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The success of the QGreenland workshop underscores the potential of integrating interactive software applications in JupyterHub. This approach not only democratizes access to advanced geospatial tools but also fosters a collaborative research environment. We look forward to supporting more workshops for QGreenland in the future!&lt;/p>

About CILogon
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#about-cilogon">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://www.cilogon.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CILogon&lt;/a> is an open source service provider that allows users to log in against over 4000 various identity providers, including campus identity providers. The available identity providers are members of
&lt;a href="https://incommon.org/federation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >InCommon&lt;/a>, a federation of universities and other organizations that provide single sign-on access to various resources.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="cilogon-and-2i2c">
CILogon and 2i2c
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#cilogon-and-2i2c">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>For the past year, 2i2c has been successfully using CILogon for more than fifteen of the hubs it manages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Currently, most of the hubs that use it are hubs for communities in education that want to manage their hub access through their own institutional providers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With using a tool like CILogon, we allow hub access to be managed both through the communities&amp;rsquo; institutional providers, but also through social providers like GitHub and Google. Because both authentication mechanisms can coexist, there&amp;rsquo;s no need to provide specific credentials for 2i2c staff in order to have access to the hub. This reduces both the burden on institution&amp;rsquo;s IT departments, but also the complexity of a hub deployment.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, as we migrate away from our current Auth0 setup, the number of hubs using CILogon will further increase in the following year.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-setup">
The setup
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-setup">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The setup that 2i2c uses, is based on two important tools, the CILogon administrative client and the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-cilogon-administrative-client">
The CILogon administrative client
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-cilogon-administrative-client">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c administrative client&lt;/a> provided by CILogon allowed us to automatically manage the CILogon OAuth applications needed for authenticating into the hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For each hub that uses CILogon, we dynamically create an OAuth
&lt;a href="https://cilogon.github.io/oa4mp/server/manuals/dynamic-client-registration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >client application&lt;/a> in CILogon and store the credentials safely, using the script at
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/blob/3312f373f0aa59fbc98dc1c8161aa9623b68726b/deployer/cilogon_app.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >cilogon_app.py&lt;/a>. The script can also used for &lt;code>updating&lt;/code> the callback URLs of an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>deleting&lt;/code> a CILogon OAuth application when a hub is removed or changes authentication methods, &lt;code>getting&lt;/code> details about an existing OAuth application, &lt;code>getting all&lt;/code> existing 2i2c CILogon OAuth applications.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="the-jupyterhub-cilogonoauthenticator">
The JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-jupyterhub-cilogonoauthenticator">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For CILogon&amp;rsquo;s integration with JupyterHub&amp;rsquo;s authentication workflow, we&amp;rsquo;re using the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator/blob/main/oauthenticator/cilogon.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;strong>CILogonOAuthenticator&lt;/strong>&lt;/a>, which is part of the
&lt;a href="https://oauthenticator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub OAuthenticator project&lt;/a>. This is what allows JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers for authentication, and it&amp;rsquo;s also a base for writing other Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of this 2i2c integration with the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator some important upstream fixes and enhancements to the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jupyterhub/oauthenticator" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >&lt;code>oauthenticator&lt;/code>&lt;/a> were identified and performed. For example, the

&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Thanks to the 2i2c - CILogon partnership, during this past year we were able to integrate CILogon into 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure and to observe its importance, usefulness and great support for 2i2c and the communities we server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are now happy to announce that the 2i2c - CILogon partnership has been expanded to another year!&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Our goal is to create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service that enables community-based cloud-native workflows in the biosciences. We will promote values of open and inclusive community practices, infrastructure that enables these practices, and a “train the trainers” approach that empowers community leaders to share expertise in cloud infrastructure with others in their communities. Our focus will be on communities in Latin America and Africa, and we hope to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities that are historically marginalized from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c will be providing cloud infrastructure operation and support for the communities that we partner with in this effort.
We will also assist with creating content to teach cloud-native workflows and assist community leaders in learning this content so that they can share these skills with others.&lt;/p>

Introduction
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#introduction">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h1>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Mybinder.org&lt;/a> enables researchers across the world to replicate computational environments in the cloud. It allows researchers to turn static code into interactive literate coding environments with a click of a button within seconds. The
&lt;a href="https://mybinder.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >mybinder.org&lt;/a> service is powered by
&lt;a href="https://binderhub.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub&lt;/a>, an open-source tool developed by
&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the Jupyter Project&lt;/a> that many organizations have deployed for their own communities. It does this by _dynamically building _the software environment needed to reproduce a computation (using a tool called
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>), and making this environment available to users.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>BinderHub was developed for use-cases that are &lt;em>temporary&lt;/em> and &lt;em>fully open&lt;/em> by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Over the past several years, the
&lt;a href="http://notebooks.gesis.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >GESIS Notebooks&lt;/a> team made the first steps towards bridging this gap through their
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Persistent BinderHub&lt;/a> implementation. This was a modified and authenticated BinderHub that &lt;em>included&lt;/em> persistent storage across sessions. The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with
&lt;a href="https://www.nfdi4datascience.de/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NFDI4DS&lt;/a> (GAN: 460234259),
&lt;a href="https://www.cessda.eu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >CESSDA&lt;/a>, and members of the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JMTE&lt;/a> project. This collaboration has three primary goals:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Generalize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure&lt;/strong>, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects&lt;/strong>, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub&lt;/strong>, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See
&lt;a href="https://github.com/orgs/2i2c-org/projects/33" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this GitHub Projects Board for issues that implement this effort&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Exploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#exploration-1-adding-persistent-storage-directly-into-binderhub">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the
&lt;a href="http://binderhub.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>. We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the
&lt;a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Persistent BinderHub codebase&lt;/a>. The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a
&lt;a href="https://github.com/gesiscss/persistent_binderhub/blob/9936fc2251abafd00921b3b53954fb60c8640347/persistent_binderhub/values.yaml" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >modified Helm Chart&lt;/a> that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality &lt;em>natively&lt;/em> into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, we decided to take another approach:&lt;/p>

&lt;/h3>&lt;p>We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, &lt;strong>we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using
&lt;a href="http://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/plasmabio/tljh-repo2docker" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >tljh-repo2docker&lt;/a> project that
&lt;a href="https://quantstack.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >QuantStack&lt;/a> had built for the
&lt;a href="https://plasmabio.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >PlasmaBio project&lt;/a>. This implementation was seen as successful, and something others in the community had wanted to generalize for some time.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="two-phases-of-implementation">
Two phases of implementation
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#two-phases-of-implementation">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Build a back-end for dynamic environment building&lt;/strong>. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>**Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and is easy and intuitive to use.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Here are a few tasks that we’re carrying out next to make progress on the above two items.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Build a working prototype for image generation via a &lt;em>JupyterHub Service&lt;/em> (see below for current status)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Research the &lt;code>tljh-repo2docker&lt;/code> code base to understand how we could build upon its UX and functionality.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the typical process that GESIS and NFDI users follow in their BinderHub workflows, to ensure that it can be replicated via this new implementation.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Perform UI/UX research validation to inform the implementation from a user’s perspective.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>As a follow-up, we’ll likely re-work the BinderHub codebase to utilize JupyterHub’s new repo2docker service, rather than defining its own custom repo2docker functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">
Back-end implementation as a JupyterHub Service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#back-end-implementation-as-a-jupyterhub-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We’re planning to use
&lt;a href="https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/services.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >JupyterHub Services&lt;/a> to add the back-end functionality for dynamic image building to a JupyterHub. Services are a way to expose functionality via a JupyterHub REST API, and would allow us to expose basic image generation on-the-fly with
&lt;a href="https://repo2docker.readthedocs.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >repo2docker&lt;/a>. We aim for basic functionality to be as close as possible to repo2docker’s default behavior, but to make this functionality _composable and customizable _if a JupyterHub administrator wants to provide different out-of-the-box functionality.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>While details may still change, we believe that the major architectural plan has now been settled. We have
&lt;a href="https://github.com/consideratio/repo2docker-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >an experimental codebase&lt;/a> with a basic implementation of the repo2docker service described above. As part of this effort, this team has also made a number of improvements to repo2docker’s codebase and project infrastructure. We hope that this effort will continue to push resources and attention to repo2docker by growing the number of users and stakeholders that rely on the project for their success.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">
Front-end implementation that uses this service
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#front-end-implementation-that-uses-this-service">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Once the back-end setup exists, we can use it to begin prototyping user interactions that can trigger and use repo2docker’s image generation. Bringing dynamic environment image building into JupyterHub is a significant improvement in its functionality, and may introduce new kinds of workflows that we hadn’t initially imagined. Understanding, interpreting, and extending the original “Persistent BinderHub” workflow will require a more thorough understanding of user stories and needs in order to identify new workflows that feel natural not only in a JupyterHub scenario but also in a Binder-like scenario.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For example, here are a few major UI/UX questions we must answer:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>When a user builds an image, should it also become available to &lt;em>other users&lt;/em> as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>How can a user store, find, and delete old images that they’ve built?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>What about new versions of the same image?&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Should we simply mimic the mybinder.org UX, or should this be improved as well?&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We must answer these and several other questions next. With that vision in place, we’d like to &lt;strong>expand our efforts in UI/UX and user research&lt;/strong>. This will help inform the technical implementation of this work as we expand on our prototype, and help us choose the right way to expose this functionality to users. We welcome collaboration around this work - if you know of an organization that is interested in collaboration, please reach out.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>After a few months working on this project, we are even more excited about the potential for dynamically building environments in a JupyterHub. We believe that it adds a new class of workflows to JupyterHubs that were not possible before, and will be immediately useful to the hundreds of communities that deploy JupyterHub for their communities.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The why, what, and how of our NASA Openscapes cloud infrastructure: 2i2c JupyterHub and corn environment</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/external-openscapes-corn/</link><pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/external-openscapes-corn/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Grant progress report: CZI Foundational grant year 2</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</link><pubDate>Sun, 13 Nov 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-year2-progress-report/</guid><description>&lt;p>We recently completed a progress report for Year 2 of our primary CZI funding grant.

&lt;h2 id="context">

&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#context">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>The Symposium was framed by the interesting and interdisciplinary scientific career of the late
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_A._Eddy" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jack Eddy&lt;/a>. Eddy&amp;rsquo;s legacy was highlighted and his influence has been extended by dynamic leadership from NASA Program Officer
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/about-us/organization-and-leadership/lead-program-scientist-for-lws" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Madhulika Guhathakurta (Lika)&lt;/a>. Lika helped launch and has sustained NASA&amp;rsquo;s
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/heliophysics/programs/living-with-a-star" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Living with a Star (LWS)&lt;/a> program over the past two decades. Prior to LWS, NASA had a variety of siloed efforts focused on near-Sun and near-Earth behavior. The LWS program led to an integration of these efforts under &amp;ldquo;system science&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;systems engineering&amp;rdquo; approaches and an expressed desired to connect LWS research activities with impacts on Earth (society, biology, culture, etc.). The program has expanded to include explorations of similar questions arising around other planets in our solar system and the recently discovered collection of exoplanets. Scientists from diverse disciplines (plasma physics, stellar evolution, atmospheric chemistry, space weather, planetary science,&amp;hellip;) work together on &amp;ldquo;cross disciplinary&amp;rdquo; research that helps us understand our lives near our star.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Symposium focused on three disciplinary areas (&lt;strong>Exoplanets&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Sun-Climate and Star-Climate interactions&lt;/strong>; &lt;strong>Risk and resilience of space weather&lt;/strong>) unified under the cross-cutting thread of &lt;strong>open science&lt;/strong>. Frequent references were made to the upcoming 2023 Year of Open Science and
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA&amp;rsquo;s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission&lt;/a>. Symposium attendees listened to talks surveying the four areas in the morning and participated in hackathon-style breakout projects during the afternoons. Work on the projects launched at the Eddy Symposium
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >continues&lt;/a>. The space weather group is investigating ways to make the power grid more resilient. The Sun-climate group is exploring plans to establish an institute focused on Sun-climate interactions and improve connections between climate and heliophysics research communities. The exoplanets team is developing tools to programmatically compare Sun-Earth and star-exoplanet interactions.&lt;/p>

&lt;a href="http://www.ryanmcgranaghan.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Ryan McGranaghan&lt;/a>, rapidly deployed a cloud-hosted JupyterHub for use during the event. The hub provided a shared space for participants to explore data, run analyses, and collaborate with one another using modern tools including Zarr, Xarray and Dask Gateway. Access to the interactive computing platform was granted to any member of the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/jack-eddy-symposium/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Symposium&amp;rsquo;s GitHub organization&lt;/a>. The work to set up that hub, openly chronicled in this GitHub issue (

Fernando described the ways he, research collaborators, and students are using the Jupyter ecosystem. Diverse and curated tools in Jupyter hubs for the
&lt;a href="https://jupytearth.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Jupyter Meets the Earth Project&lt;/a> and
&lt;a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Berkeley&amp;rsquo;s data science programs&lt;/a> were highlighted. The talk showcased how these tools have been integrated to support individuals and communities of practice in data-driven research. In response to requests from the organizers and participants, Fernando gave a demonstration on how to use the hub 2i2c set up for the Symposium and an introduction to version control using &lt;code>git&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c co-founder Jim Colliander gave a talk titled
&lt;a href="https://bit.ly/eddy-science-commons" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Governing the Science Commons&lt;/a>. Three key points from Jim&amp;rsquo;s talk were: the virtue that should guide the improvements to the scientific enterprise is intellectual generosity; implementation of intellectual generosity into science requires commons-based governance; the convergence of open source tools that support data-intensive collaborative research and learning (as showcased by Fernando) and agency interest (
&lt;a href="https://science.nasa.gov/open-science/transform-to-open-science" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >NASA TOPS&lt;/a>,

The talk ended with a call to action for the diverse communities represented at the Symposium to improve the ways we do science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="things-we-learned">
Things we learned
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#things-we-learned">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Our experience with the Symposium taught 2i2c a few things.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned that our engineering team can rapidly deploy interactive computing resources to support a research and education community. Along the way, we confirmed what we&amp;rsquo;ve been learning from Pangeo and the neuroscience communities: flexible methods to customize the software environment are necessary. We confirmed that our developing
&lt;a href="https://docs.2i2c.org/about/service/shared-responsibility.html?highlight=shared%20responsibility" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >shared responsibility model&lt;/a>, enabling domain-specific experts to provide curated toolchains for their communities while leveraging 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s infrastructure expertise, is the right approach.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We learned that managing access to the hub using members in a GitHub organization works but involves some toil since organizers had to work through the GitHub invitation process for each participant. We are exploring others ways to systematically grant event participants access to a hub.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The Eddy Symposium experience reminded us that some skill at using &lt;code>git&lt;/code> is vital for collaboration. Fernando&amp;rsquo;s brief introduction to &lt;code>git&lt;/code> provided
&lt;a href="https://jack-eddy-symposium.github.io/intro-git-jupyter/intro-git/git-visuals.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the mental model of working on a directed acyclyic graph&lt;/a>. Roving support from Jim and Fernando during the afternoon hackathon sessions normalized the skill level across the groups but not without a few merge conflicts and frustration. Near the beginning of future workshops, we will follow an improved approach aimed at establishing good &lt;code>git&lt;/code> hygeine and familiarity with the collaboration workflow using a simple pull request.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are honored to have had the opportunity to collaborate with the Eddy Symposium team by managing infrastructure and participating in the workshop. We learned a lot about how to support the Helio and adjacent communities, and are proud of the ways in which our infrastructure helped them do their work more openly and effectively. We hope to build on these successes with these and other communities in the future!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</link><pubDate>Tue, 16 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/</guid><description>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://pangeo.io/cloud.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo Cloud&lt;/a> is an experimental service providing public cloud-based data-science environments for data-intensive geoscience research.
We have recently finished re-creating the
&lt;a href="http://pangeo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Pangeo&lt;/a> community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the
&lt;a href="https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c-org/infrastructure&lt;/a> repository.
This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one!
The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community.
It will be available at the same URL (
&lt;a href="https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io&lt;/a>) and there&amp;rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place.
Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work.
Please see
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/migration-of-us-central1-b-gcp-pangeo-io-to-2i2c-infrastructure/1890" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >this Discourse thread&lt;/a> as an initial place to provide feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On &lt;strong>22nd November 2021&lt;/strong>, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub.
Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">
History of Pangeo Cloud Hubs
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#history-of-pangeo-cloud-hubs">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the
&lt;a href="https://annual.ametsoc.org/2017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting&lt;/a>; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs.
This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable.
Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure.
However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed.
Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">
The Pangeo-2i2c Partnership
&lt;a class="header-anchor" href="#the-pangeo-2i2c-partnership">#&lt;/a>
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>
&lt;a href="https://2i2c.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >2i2c&lt;/a> is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows.
We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem.
We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Similarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities.
Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c&amp;rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project&amp;rsquo;s technical stacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities.
We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this
&lt;a href="https://discourse.pangeo.io/t/notes-from-the-pangeo-2i2c-kick-off-meeting/1587" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >kick-off thread on Discourse&lt;/a>.
This approach allows each community to focus on it&amp;rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo&amp;rsquo;s workflows.
In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c.
Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community.
We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! &amp;#x1f680;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>A deep dive into MyST, Part 2: The MyST-Parser, Docutils and Sphinx</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-2/</link><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-2/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A deep dive into MyST, Part 1: The MyST-Parser Python API usage in Nikola</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-1/</link><pubDate>Mon, 23 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-1/</guid><description/></item><item><title>2i2c partners with UC Berkeley and CloudBank to provide data science education hubs for community colleges in California</title><link>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/data8-class/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/data8-class/</guid><description>&lt;p>

&lt;a href="https://www.data8.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >Data8&lt;/a> began as a large introductory data science class at UC Berkeley. It uses a Jupyter Book for all course materials, and uses JupyterHub magic links to distribute course content from the textbook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>2i2c is working with the Data 8 team to deploy JupyterHubs for community colleges in California that run the Data8 course, to make the infrastructure and content broadly accessible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Giving people curricula, content, and infrastructure goes a long way to adoption. Communities want to remix content for their specific needs.&lt;/p>
