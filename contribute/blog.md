# Blog

Our blog is our primary mehcanism for recording what we do and the impact we've had. It also gives us a record of our work that we can quickly use for generating reports.

## Principles to follow

- **Blog about anything that leans into [our value proposition](https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/value-proposition/)**.
- **Shorter, imperfect, and more frequent**.
- **Communicate any time we learn something**.
- **Share attribution with collaborators**.
- **Write for [our target audience](https://compass.2i2c.org/marketing/strategy/#our-audience)**.

See the **Tags and categories** section below for inspiration about what to blog about.

## How to create a new blog post

Copy the blog post folder template at the path below:

```
content/blog/_template-post
```

It contains an `index.md` file that you can modify. Put it in the folder for the year in which you're posting (e.g.: `content/blog/2025/mypostfolder`).
