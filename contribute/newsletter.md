# Guide to the monthly newsletter

This is a guide to creating the monthly 2i2c community update. We frame this update as a "dispatch": a short, proactive, and curated update on our most important work. It should not be exhaustive - only cover the most important points.

## Guiding principles

Our goal is to **be transparent**, **demonstrate expertise**, and **demonstrate impact** with our community by proactively sharing our work. Here are some guiding principles we follow:

* **Mission-driven:** We are a non-profit, not a SaaS company. Our updates reflect this "partnership" model. We celebrate sustainability (like new members) as a community win.  
* **Blog-first:** Our blog is the content engine. We write individual posts there first. The monthly email *curates and distributes* this content; it doesn't create new content from scratch.  
* **Human-centered:** Use a personal, direct voice (e.g., `From: Chris from 2i2c`).  
* **Utility-focused:** Be useful and scannable. Respect our reader's time.  
* **Consistent:** A "good enough" update sent on schedule is better than a "perfect" one sent late. This and our blog are our community "heartbeat."

## Monthly workflow

Follow this to create the newsletter each month.

### Curate

* Gather all blog posts from the last 30 days.  
* Define the **Monthly Theme** in one sentence (e.g., "This month was all about sustainability.").  
* Select the **"Lead Story"** (our biggest win).  
* Select 2-4 **"Featured Stories"** that map to our [core value proposition](https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/value-proposition/) and [strategy](https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/strategy/). Here are a few key areas, each with their own `category:` in blog metadata:
  * **Community Impact:** (e.g., A research group's success, a great workshop).  
  * **Upstream Impact:** (e.g., A fix for Jupyter, a Binder report).  
  * **Service Enhancements:** (e.g., A new hub feature, a support story).  
  * **Organization Updates:** (e.g., major new announcements or updates on our strategy).  
* Find a **"Community Spotlight"** (e.g., a new contributor to thank).

### Write the newsletter

* Use [the template in the next section](#template) to write the full email.  
* Review to make sure it makes sense as a holistic newsletter.

### Send

* Send the email to our mailing list via [MailChimp](https://compass.2i2c.org/marketing/mailinglist/).  
  * Copy the campaign from the previous month
  * Update the **Subject** and **Content** with the newsletter we just wrote.

## Template

*This is the short, 300-500 word email for our mailing list.*

**From:** `Chris from 2i2c`
**Title:** `[2i2c Update] <A brief, specific hook, e.g., "Our first premier member & a 400-person NASA workshop">`

*[Intro summary. Example: "October was a milestone month for us in building out our new membership model towards organizational sustainability. We’ve spent the last few months designing the basic structure of membership, and this month welcome our first premier member: the Berkeley Institute for Data Science! We think this is a key foundational step towards refining and building out this member network. Along the way, we’ve been hard at work to highlight all the work our community members and collaborators are doing. Check out a few highlights from last month below from our blog.”]*
