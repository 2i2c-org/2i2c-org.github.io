## Accomplishment 3: Create an organization from scratch

One of the first things that you realize when you start an organization is how much structure and process is taken for granted in pre-existing organizations. The policies, norms, practices, and organizational structure in any group tend to be created well before an individual arrives there.

The one time that this *isn’t* the case is when you’re creating the organization from scratch. This is both really scary and really exciting! You can make any choice you want, unburdened from “this is the way we’ve always done things here”. But what if you make the wrong choice?! Will you dig your organization into a hole from day one?

Perhaps our biggest accomplishment this year was **creating the foundation of a team**. What began as a free-form collection of people and GitHub repositories has slowly evolved into a more structured set of organizational practices and team norms. Here are a few major steps towards this accomplishment:

- We created [Our Team Compass](http://team-compass.2i2c.org) as the definitive source of truth for all of 2i2c’s operations. This is the best single description of “what is 2i2c, and how does it operate?”. It is both a resource for our team, as well as for the outside world to understand what we’re doing and how we do it.
- Our [Structure and Governance](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/structure.html) page defined the major groups that make up 2i2c - as of the end of year 1, these are the Steering Council, Executive Director, Engineering Team, and our fiscal sponsor, [Code for Science and Society](http://codeforscience.org). In addition, our [Code of Conduct](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/code-of-conduct/index.html) describes the behaviors that we expect out of people that participate in 2i2c spaces.
- Our [Team Practices](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/index.html) guide has information about our daily and weekly planning workflow. This describes how we coordinate and plan our actions as a distributed team.

There is a lot more in our team compass, and we invite you to give it a read to learn more about how we operate. These are living documents, and we’ll continue to improve them as we learn more.

### Challenges we faced

**Iterating in the face of uncertainty**. The biggest challenge in creating a new organization is accepting the fact that there is not a single “right” way to do things. You can investigate similar organizations from which you can draw inspiration, but there’s nobody there to tell you what is “right” or “wrong”. However, you need to start somewhere, and so we have tried to adopt a process of continual reflection and improvement rather than trying to get things perfect the first time.

**Working as a fully distributed team**.  2i2c's team is split across more than 6 time zones, and there are no times of the day when we're all in standard "working hours". This adds extra complexity in team communications, coordination, and meetings.  We have had to learn how to coordinate and plan asynchronously, usually via GitHub issues, Slack, and [our Team Compass](http://team-compass.2i2c.org). We have steadily gotten better at executing as a group, and we continue to improve and iterate!

### Where we’re heading next

In the coming year we are excited to continue refining our team processes in order to more effectively carry out the “design → implementation → deployment” loop. We’d like to improve our processes for coordinating with key open source communities around development or fundraising opportunities. We’d also like to diversify our team’s structure beyond our current engineering core, and bring on more team members with an expertise and interest in product and community management.
