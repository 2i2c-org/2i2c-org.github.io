        We do this by operating shared cloud infrastructure for research and education communities, and by contributing to the open source tools they depend on.

      text: |
        Research and education communities face a difficult choice: manage fragile self-built infrastructure, or rely on proprietary platforms that create vendor lock-in. Either way, communities work in isolation. They can't pool resources, share learnings, or collectively invest in the open source tools they depend on.

      text: |
        2i2c creates a connection between communities using open infrastructure, the team operating it, and the open source projects it's built on. By serving many communities through [shared infrastructure](/platform) and a unified [roadmap](https://2i2c.org/roadmap), we identify common needs, develop solutions that work across contexts, and contribute improvements upstream where they benefit everyone.

        {{< figure src="/membership/images/collaborative-model.png" alt="Diagram showing the collaborative model: member communities use their hub to have impact, they influence our open roadmap with feedback and co-funding, which drives contributions across the open source ecosystem, which creates better tools for our members and for the world." >}}

        This transforms a fragmented landscape into a virtuous cycle. Communities get reliable infrastructure without operational burden. Open source projects get sustained contribution and real-world feedback. And the broader ecosystem benefits from improvements that would never happen if every community worked alone.
