We are defined and driven by our mission, and believe
that values are crucial to accomplishing our goals in a way that is equitable
and accessible to all.

Here are some of the core values underlying 2i2c:

* 2i2c values fairness and justice as requirements for successful communities.
* 2i2c values learning and discovery for all people.
* 2i2c values collaborating and connecting to foster environments for learning and discovery.

We serve these values through a commitment to a few core principles:

* Build tools that maximize flexibility and choice
* Collaborate with open source and scientific communities
* Provide community and core support, not just new features
* Build tools that are accessible along a variety of dimensions

These principles help us guarantee our users the [Right to Replicate](/right-to-replicate) 
the infrastructure we manage for them without having to rely on us.
