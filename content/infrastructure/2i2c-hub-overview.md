# What is a 2i2c Managed JupyterHub?

A 2i2c Managed [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/) is a distribution of open source tools that provide interactive computing environments in the cloud.

2i2c **designs JupyterHub distributions** that are created for research and education. These JupyterHub distributions can run on almost any kind of cloud infrastructure (or even your own local hardware) and are designed in partnership with stakeholders in research, education, and open source communities.

2i2c also **manages JupyterHub distributions** as a service. This allows researchers and educators to access the best technology for interactive data science, without managing their own cloud infrastructure.

2i2c believes in each user's [Right to Replicate](/right-to-replicate) their
infrastructure. All 2i2c infrastructure is community-supported and open source, and we follow community-vetted best practices in deploying the infrastructure. 

For more information about the 2i2c Hubs, see [the 2i2c Hubs Pilot documentation](https://pilot.2i2c.org/en/latest/).
