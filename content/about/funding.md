- **Project-focused grants**. We lead and collaborate on several projects that involve developing and supporting infrastructure for research and education. See [our projects page](/projects) for more information.
- **Donations and core support**. We raise central funding that provides crucial core support for 2i2c's operations, and supports our time in supporting open source communities.
