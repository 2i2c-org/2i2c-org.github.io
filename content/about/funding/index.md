# How we are funded

To sustain and grow our operations, 2i2c receives funding from the following sources:

- **Revenue from managed services**. We build self-sustaining cloud services that generate revenue through management and support contracts. See [our services page](/platform) for more information.
- **Project-focused grants**. We lead and collaborate on several projects that involve developing and supporting infrastructure for research and education. See [our projects page](/projects) for more information.
- **Core organizational support**. We raise core funding that covers the costs of strategically-critical roles that are not easily linked to specific deliverables and contracts.
