The [Pangeo project](https://pangeo.io/) is a community platform for Big Data geoscience. It runs several
JupyterHubs and BinderHubs for geoscience communities, and is a pioneer in integrating
open source technology and standards with cloud infrastructure to facilitate access
and computation with extremely large datasets.
