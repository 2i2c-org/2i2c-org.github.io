# Open practices at 2i2c

We believe that open science requires open practices - here are a few ways we lean into open practices and support open communities at 2i2c.
See [our open source strategy](https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/strategy/#upstream-first) for more details about the practices we follow.

## Support open technology with our service

- Build our services with open technology and [commit to licensing practices that prevent negative outcomes](../open-technology/index.md).
- Give communities the [Right to Replicate their infrastructure without 2i2c](../right-to-replicate/index.md).

## Be an excellent upstream citizen

- Provide both [Directed and Foundational open source contributions](../blog/2025/good-citizen/index.md).
- Take an [Upstream-first approach to improving our infrastructure](https://compass.2i2c.org/open-source/strategy/#upstream-first) so that others benefit from our effort.

## Do our work openly and transparently

- Be transparent about [organizations that support and fund us](../about/funding/index.md).
- Show our work and priorities by [communicating in-progress work on our blog](../blog/2025/communications-strategy/index.md), even if it's in an imperfect state.
