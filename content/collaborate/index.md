Here are a few ways that you can connect with and collaborate with 2i2c.

## Use and support our managed JupyterHub services

2i2c aims to provide Managed JupyterHubs in the cloud that are customized for communities in research and education.
We are exploring sustainability and services models around this goal, and invite feedback and ideas for ways that we can improve this service.
We are running JupyterHubs for many communities already, and are accepting new communities in batches as our capacity grows.
If you are interested in having a managed JupyterHub for your community, [check out our cloud service page](/platform) for more information or send an email to [`partnerships@2i2c.org`](mailto:partnerships@2i2c.org) to discuss.

## Pitch a project or grant

Our team is always looking out for opportunities to collaborate and learn from others in order to have an impact.
Sometimes these can even lead to new grant ideas or ongoing projects.
If you have an idea for collaboration that is aligned with our mission, and that would benefit from our skills and perspective, please send an email to [`partnerships@2i2c.org`](mailto:partnerships@2i2c.org) and we can discuss.
