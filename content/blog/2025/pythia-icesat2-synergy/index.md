At today's [Project Pythia community meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQWQrgHs_G5XyNH5GTFYydH_woUZcyZibdxPUWLpqFUYs20WM93kdx5onwOaizC_3-tfnbreMNQbYAp/pub), [Project Pythia](/collaborators/pythia/) met with representatives from [ICESat-2](../../../collaborators/cryocloud/) to share learning about notebooks and cookbooks in educational settings.

Anthony Arendt from UW's eScience Institute shared how they've used educational notebooks in their hackweek programs. The discussion explored ways to improve cookbooks, especially for large collections that require different computational environments, sparking ideas about higher-level abstractions for organizing educational content.

One of our service goals is to make it easier for our member communities to _learn from one another_ - using standardized tools and infrastructure means we can learn what works, what doesn't, and collectively improve our workflows more quickly.
