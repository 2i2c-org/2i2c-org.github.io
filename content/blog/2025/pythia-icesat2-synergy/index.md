We wanted to share a short vignette about two of our communities learning from one another.

At the latest [Project Pythia community meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vQWQrgHs_G5XyNH5GTFYydH_woUZcyZibdxPUWLpqFUYs20WM93kdx5onwOaizC_3-tfnbreMNQbYAp/pub), [Project Pythia](/collaborators/pythia/) met with representatives from [ICESat-2](../../../collaborators/cryocloud/) to share learning about notebooks and cookbooks in educational settings.

Anthony Arendt from UW's eScience Institute shared how they've used educational notebooks in their hackweek programs. The discussion explored ways to improve cookbooks, especially for large collections that require different computational environments, sparking ideas about higher-level abstractions for organizing educational content. There is a lot of overlap in the needs and workflows of these communities, and we're hopeful they can find ways to re-use one another's ideas, content, and infrastructure.

One of our service goals is to make it easier for our member communities to _learn from one another_ - using standardized tools and infrastructure means we can learn what works, what doesn't, and collectively improve our workflows more quickly. We're working on ways to encourage this kind of interaction in our member networks, so we wanted to celebrate this little win.
