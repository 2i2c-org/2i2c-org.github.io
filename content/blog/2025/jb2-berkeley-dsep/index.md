Chris gave a talk about Jupyter Book 2 and MyST at the [UC Berkeley Data Science Education Program](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsep)'s annual meeting. It covered the next direction for the Jupyter Book project, and its recent adoption of the [MyST Document Engine](https://mystmd.org) for Jupyter Book 2.
