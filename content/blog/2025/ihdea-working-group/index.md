The Science Platforms Coordination IHDEA working group (which includes our own [Jim Colliander](/authors/jim-colliander/)) is developing international standard software computing environments for Heliophysics. The working group recently presented their work at two major conferences: [ML-Helio](https://ml-helio.github.io/) in Madrid and [DASH/IHDEA](https://dash2025.space.swri.edu/) in San Antonio.

When the working group received $2k from NASA SMCE for cloud infrastructure, they were already member organizations of 2i2c. This meant we could quickly stand up a [JupyterHub](/collaborators/jupyterhub/) with their Heliophysics-tailored environments for the conferences:

- **Easy access** - Shared password authentication for conference attendees
- **Persistent storage** - Work saved across sessions
- **Serious compute** - Up to 119 GB RAM and 15 CPUs (much more than a typical laptop!)

The team successfully demonstrated how cloud resources can enable computational work that laptops simply can't handle, and conference attendees responded positively to the presentations.

## Why we're excited about this

This showcases a key benefit we want to create with 2i2c membership: **reducing the accidental complexity of leveraging the cloud**. Because the working group was already a member organization, deploying and managing infrastructure for the conferences was straightforward once they secured cloud funding. No lengthy setup, no new contracts - just quick deployment of the tools they needed.
