We are proud to announce that 2i2c's Executive Director, Chris Holdgraf, was [recently elected to Jupyter's Executive Council](https://blog.jupyter.org/project-jupyters-2025-executive-council-elections-605b183ec64c). The 2i2c team discussed whether Chris should run for this position last year, and concluded that it was a way for our non-profit to both support Jupyter's mission at a strategic level, and represent the interests of research and education communities in Jupyter's direction. Chris wrote [a blog post about his reasons for running](https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2025/jupyter-org-structure) with more information.

One of Chris' goals is to be a transparent source of information about what the council is working on, where its priorities lie, and what are the major challenges it is trying to tackle. He's written two blog posts that describe some of his experiences so far, at the links below:

- [On the ways that the Jupyter Foundation could support the Jupyter Project with its funds](https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2025/os-support)
- [A high-level overview of Jupyter's structure](https://chrisholdgraf.com/blog/2025/jupyter-org-structure)

We're hopeful that this is a way for 2i2c to scale its impact and lean into its [commitment to open technology](/open-technology/). Chris intends to keep writing about his personal experience via [his blog](https://chrisholdgraf.com), and we'll provide updates here for major developments that are relevant to 2i2c's network of communities.
We're proud to have Chris in this role, and excited for his contributions to the Jupyter community!
