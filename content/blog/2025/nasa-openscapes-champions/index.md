[Openscapes](../../collaborators/openscapes) ran a NASA Champions program in November, bringing 30 participants together to learn about NASA Earthdata and the earthaccess Python library. We provided JupyterHub infrastructure for hands-on breakout sessions on Day 2 - it's a good example of using a shared JupyterHub to facilitate learning and collaboration in a remote event.

The event covered topics like dataset discovery and cloud compute access, and the OpenScapes team grew at least 7 more members in their Slack after the event post-event at least 7 folks joined the Openscapes Slack, one came to their biweekly hackday, and several registered for their December 15 earthaccess hack.

Read their [full event summary](https://openscapes.org/blog/2025-11-27-nasa-champions-2025-summary/) to learn how they structured the program and engaged their community.
