*Thank you to Emilio Mayorga for sharing this publication.* 

Several community members, including [Paige Martin](https://github.com/paigem) (Australian Climate Simulator), [Eli Holmes](https://github.com/eeholmes) (NOAA Fisheries), and [Emilio Mayorga](https://github.com/emiliom/) (University of Washington) published case studies in [Oceanography magazine's "Vision for Capacity Sharing" issue](https://tos.org/oceanography/issue/volume-38-issue-1).

Their article [Harnessing Marine Open Data Science for Ocean Sustainability in Africa, South Asia, and Latin America](https://tos.org/oceanography/article/harnessing-marine-open-data-science-for-ocean-sustainability-in-africa-south-asia-and-latin-america) highlights the benefits of hackweek-style collaboration and learning events to build capacity in underrepresented communities, using 2i2c-supported JupyterHub for seamless set up and effective data sharing.  

More on these three specific initiatives is available at their respective websites:
- [COESSING](https://coessing.org), Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School In Nigeria and Ghana. 
- [OHWe](https://intercoonecta.github.io) - OceanHackWeek en Espa√±ol (in Spanish). 
- [ITCOocean Hack2Week](https://hackweek-itcoocean.github.io/2023-Hackbook/) (an Indian Ocean program). Training Course & HackWeek On Machine Learning Based Species Distribution Modeling.

We're happy to see these communities extend their impact and make interactive computing more accessible to participants around the world.
