This year several team members attended [JupyterCon 2025](https://jupytercon.com) to show off our own work and the upstream work that we've been doing in open source.
JupyterCon recently shared the videos of all talks, so here's a quick run-down of 2i2c's contributions and where you can watch more.

## Building computational narratives with Jupyter Book

[Introducing Jupyter Book 2: Next-generation Tools for Creating Computational Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MUSteQFGq8&t=850s) - Chris Holdgraf and Rowan Cockett ([Curvenote](https://curvenote.com)) introduce the next generation of [Jupyter Book](../../../collaborators/jupyter-book/), built on modern tooling and designed for creating rich computational narratives.

[Tutorial: Build-a-Jupyter Book With the Turing Way](https://jupytercon2025.sched.com/event/1jNKI) - Angus Hollands co-led this hands-on tutorial teaching participants how to create their own Jupyter Books using examples from the Turing Way.

## JupyterHub's evolution and sustainable operations

[Not Just for Notebooks: JupyterHub in 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wwia9YzHO) - Yuvi Panda explores how [JupyterHub](../../../collaborators/jupyterhub/) is evolving beyond just notebooks to support a wider range of interactive computing workflows.

[Cloudy With a Chance of Savings: Per-User Usage and Cost Monitoring for JupyterHubs in the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5x3bTgRzVs) - Jenny Wong presents our recent work improving tools and approaches for monitoring per-user cloud costs in JupyterHub deployments, helping communities operate more sustainably.

[Lightning Talk: Controlling Home Directory Costs (with User Empathy) on the Cloud](https://jupytercon2025.sched.com/event/1jNQC) - Yuvi Panda shares practical strategies for managing home directory storage costs while keeping user experience in mind, using `jupyterhub-home-nfs`.

Finally, there were also several talks that weren't _by_ 2i2c team members, but were partially _enabled_ by 2i2c's collaboration. We're particularly proud of these, because it's an example of us bringing others into the ecosystem and empowering them to contribute.

## Understanding the JupyterHub community

[Findings from the Voices of JupyterHub report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnsD_Ly49Z0) - This community strategy talk shares insights from conversations with JupyterHub users and operators about their needs and challenges. It's not given by a 2i2c team member, but many of us have been involved in guiding (and being participants in!) this project.
