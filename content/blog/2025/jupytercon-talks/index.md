This year several team members attended [JupyterCon 2025](https://jupytercon.com) to show off our own work and the upstream work that we've been doing in open source.
JupyterCon recently shared the videos of all talks, so here's a quick run-down of 2i2c's contributions and where you can watch more.

## Building computational narratives with Jupyter Book

[Introducing Jupyter Book 2: Next-generation Tools for Creating Computational Narratives](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3MUSteQFGq8&t=850s) - Chris Holdgraf and Rowan Cockett ([Curvenote](https://curvenote.com)) introduce the next generation of [Jupyter Book](../../../collaborators/jupyter-book/), built on modern tooling and designed for creating rich computational narratives.

[Tutorial: Build-a-Jupyter Book With the Turing Way](https://jupytercon2025.sched.com/event/1jNKI) - Angus Hollands co-led this hands-on tutorial teaching participants how to create their own Jupyter Books using examples from the Turing Way.

## JupyterHub's evolution and sustainable operations

[Not Just for Notebooks: JupyterHub in 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wwia9YzHO) - Yuvi Panda explores how [JupyterHub](../../../collaborators/jupyterhub/) is evolving beyond just notebooks to support a wider range of interactive computing workflows.

[Cloudy With a Chance of Savings: Per-User Usage and Cost Monitoring for JupyterHubs in the Cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M5x3bTgRzVs) - Jenny Wong presents our recent work improving tools and approaches for monitoring per-user cloud costs in JupyterHub deployments, helping communities operate more sustainably.

[Lightning Talk: Controlling Home Directory Costs (with User Empathy) on the Cloud](https://jupytercon2025.sched.com/event/1jNQC) - Yuvi Panda shares practical strategies for managing home directory storage costs while keeping user experience in mind, using `jupyterhub-home-nfs`.

Finally, there were also several talks that weren't _by_ 2i2c team members, but were partially _enabled_ by 2i2c's collaboration. We're particularly proud of these, because it's an example of us bringing others into the ecosystem and empowering them to contribute.

## Understanding the JupyterHub community

[Findings from the Voices of JupyterHub report](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnsD_Ly49Z0) - This community strategy talk shares insights from conversations with JupyterHub users and operators about their needs and challenges. It's not given by a 2i2c team member, but many of us have been involved in guiding (and being participants in!) this project.

## Pythia sharing their MyST journey

[MyST-ifying Project Pythia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SqmMoyqSU8o) - Julia Kent of NSF NCAR discusses [Project Pythia](../../../collaborators/pythia/), an open-source platform dedicated to educating geoscientists on Python for complex Earth data analysis. Learn how Project Pythia manages its expansive repository of "cookbooks" and educational content, detailing their strategic shift to MyST Markdown and [Jupyter Book](../../../collaborators/jupyter-book/) 2 to drastically improve project sustainability and reduce maintenance overhead.

## How CryoCloud built a healthy open science community

[Building a successful open science community in the cloud](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XD72H0Dkhq8) - Tasha Snow shares key insights from running the [CryoCloud](../../../collaborators/cryocloud/) [JupyterHub](../../../collaborators/jupyterhub/), emphasizing that a successful scientific community relies on both technology and social innovation. She shares data-driven results on how shared JupyterHubs can significantly reduce research computing costs and accelerate scientific iteration. She also explores the critical balance between platform capabilities and the need for _social infrastructure_ to overcome technical barriers and foster true collaboration.
