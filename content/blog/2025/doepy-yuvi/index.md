Our Technical Lead [Yuvi Panda](../../authors/yuvi-panda/_index.md) recently gave a talk at the [doepy meetup](https://meetup.doepy.org/) about JupyterHub's interest in moving beyond the "single-user notebook application" and towards a more flexible approach to enabling administrators to deploy many different types of applications and environments.

Check out a video of the talk here:

This is an important step for the JupyterHub project in order to support the many different kinds of workflows that data scientists need to use in their work. We hope that this generates more interest in the JupyterHub project and gives us useful feedback to guide the team's understanding of this direction.
