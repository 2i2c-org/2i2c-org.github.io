[Marimo announced they've been acquired by CoreWeave](https://marimo.io/blog/joining-coreweave) this week. Congratulations to the Marimo team for their hard work paying off! Marimo is an impressive product with excellent functionality, and we're excited to see what they build next.

This acquisition also highlights something important: **the value of multi-stakeholder governance in open source**.

## Why governance matters

For years, people have talked about Marimo "replacing" [Jupyter](../../../collaborators/jupyter/). At a product level, Marimo has indeed built an excellent tool and platform. For example, they've really moved the needle on reactive notebook workflows (and we're excited about community projects like [ipyflow](https://github.com/ipyflow/ipyflow) that build on ideas [originally explored by the Cal Poly Jupyter team 7 years ago](https://github.com/jupytercalpoly/reactivepy)).

But **[Jupyter](../../../collaborators/jupyter/) differentiates in a key way**: it's governed and led by a community of peers, not a single company.

This acquisition demonstrates why that matters. Marimo's product roadmap is now driven by CoreWeave's business strategy. That might be great for users, or it might not. Either way, it highlights how single-company ownership shapes the direction of tools that communities depend on.

## Jupyter will never be acquired

That's a feature, not a bug.

We're excited to continue supporting [Jupyter](/collaborators/jupyter/) as a healthy, multi-stakeholder community. This means things like:

- **Foundational governance contributions**: Serving on [Jupyter's Executive Council](https://jupyter.org/governance/executive_council.html) and co-leading several sub-projects
- **Community building**: Supporting JupyterCon and the Community Building working group
- **Long-term investment**: Building infrastructure that strengthens the entire ecosystem

Multi-stakeholder governance means [Jupyter's](../../../collaborators/jupyter/) future is decided by its community, not by any single company's acquisition or business pivot. This is a core part of the open source ecosystem we all rely on, and 2i2c's team is excited to continue supporting that ecosystem.
