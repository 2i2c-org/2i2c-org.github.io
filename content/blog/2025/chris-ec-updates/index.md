This is a running blog post for Chris to share out community updates from his time on the [Jupyter Executive Council](https://ec.jupyter.org/). 

## Community updates from Chris

Chris aims to write monthly updates for Jupyter's community in the [Jupyter Community Forum](https://discourse.jupyter.org/c/governance/executive-council/51) to share his perspective on what the council is up to. We'll update this index post as new posts are available.

## 2i2c's commitment to supporting open source communities

In early 2025, Chris was [elected to the Jupyter Executive Council](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/jupyter-executive-council/). 
We're tracking these efforts because we believe that providing leadership and community support to open source projects is a key way in which 2i2c can have impact, and we make time for team members like Chris to contribute upstream in strategic ways like this. However, this kind of work is very difficult to track! This blog post is an attempt at putting these efforts into one place for us to track and for others to discover.

## Acknowledgements

Chris' time on the Jupyter Executive Council is supported by fees from 2i2c's [network of member communities](https://2i2c.org/communities/).
