We are excited to announce that **dashboards to monitor cloud usage and costs at a per-user level** are now available! See the [cost monitoring documentation](https://docs.2i2c.org/admin/monitoring/cost-users) for more information.

A key goal of 2i2c is to make the cloud safe for science. By providing transparent cost monitoring, we give communities the confidence that they won't face unexpected bills and can better understand how their usage patterns translate to cloud costs. This visibility is especially valuable in our shared platform model, where each community gets their own independent hub while benefiting from shared infrastructure expertise.

The user-level cost breakdown allows communities to identify individual usage trends and manage their resources more effectively. Communities can now see exactly how their computational work translates to cloud spending, enabling better resource planning and budget management.
