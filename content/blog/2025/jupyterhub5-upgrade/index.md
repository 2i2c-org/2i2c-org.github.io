We are excited to announce that all 2i2c hubs now run JupyterHub 5.0!

This is an upgrade that brings some exciting new features and improvements. Some of the highlights include:
1. The possibility to enable [user-initiated server sharing](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/5.0.0/tutorial/sharing.html)
2. [Authenticator-managed roles](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/5.0.0/reference/authenticators.html#authenticator-managed-roles)

Also, JupyterHub 5 will enable us to offer per-group shared directories in the future! [Tracking Issue](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/veda-jupyterhub/issues/61).
