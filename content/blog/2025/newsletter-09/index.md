September was a big month for giving our communities better visibility into their infrastructure. We shipped [per-user cost dashboards](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/cloud-cost-monitoring/), launched a [status page at status.2i2c.org](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/status-page/), and [cut baseline AWS costs](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/aws-cost-reduction/) by switching to more efficient instance types. We also helped CCAD gain [more control over their computing infrastructure](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/catalyst-hardware-exchange/) through a hardware exchange, and shared our thinking about [being responsible open source citizens](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/good-citizen/). Here's what stood out:

## Enabling transparent cloud cost monitoring with user-level dashboards

We shipped dashboards that let communities monitor cloud usage and costs at a per-user level. This gives communities confidence they won't face unexpected bills and helps them understand how their usage patterns translate to cloud costs. Communities can now see exactly how their computational work translates to spending, enabling better resource planning and budget management.

## Demonstrating our infrastructure's reliability with a hub status page for our communities

We launched a status page at status.2i2c.org that gives communities a high-level view of our infrastructure's stability. This is a single source of truth for understanding whether your hub is experiencing problems and helps us respond to outages fasterâ€”ideally before communities even notice. We're also streamlining our incident response processes to make outages less frequent and shorter when they do occur.

## Reducing base infrastructure costs on AWS with smarter instance types

We reduced the baseline costs of running our AWS infrastructure by switching from older r5.xlarge instances to newer, more efficient r8i-flex.large instances. These are the core nodes that keep hubs "always available" for users. The graph below shows daily savings for one communityâ€”we're rolling this out to all new clusters and gradually migrating existing ones.
