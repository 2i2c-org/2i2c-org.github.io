One of 2i2c's goals is to **make the cloud safe for science**.
A big part of this is making the black box of commercial cloud infrastructure more predictable and reliable, while running a network of community hubs that all operate autonomously.

As part of this effort, we've created a **status page for 2i2c's network of community hubs**. This is a source of truth to provide a high-level picture of the stability of our infrastructure, and to give us a heads up when things aren't working as expected. You can check it out at:

As part of this process, we've also [streamlined our incident response processes](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/pull/1021) in order to more quickly respond to outages when they occur (ideally, before a community has even noticed!).

There are still plenty of improvements we'd like to make: for example, we're focusing on major outages right now, but would like to extend some level of reporting for _degraded_ service, like unexpectedly slow start times.
