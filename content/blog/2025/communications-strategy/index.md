At 2i2c, we aim to be an exemplar organization in working openly, supporting open science, and supporting open source communities in everything that we do.
We believe that [open science is a process, not a product](TODO LINK TO OPEN PRACTICES PAGE), and commit to following practices that align with open principles throughout our work.

A key principle for our team has always been **working in the open**.
We do almost all of our work in our own public repositories or in upstream community spaces.
However, we've still struggled to _communicate what we've been up to_.
We can't expect everybody to keep an eye on the spaces where 2i2c operates in order to learn whether we are actually living up to our goals.

So, we're going to try an expriment that is [inspired by Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/). In short, here's what we aim to do:

- Use our blog any time we learn or do something that's aligned with our value proposition. This includes [our value for our member communities](TODO: ADD LINK) as well as our [value for open communities and values](TODO: ADD LINK).
- Don't hesitate to share in-progress work and things that are still rough - this is part of working in the open.
- Occasionally, share posts that help readers navigate this stream of short impact posts. We'll use [our Mailing List](TODO: Add link) for this, so click that link if you'd like to sign up.

Our hope is that this will give us a steady stream of posts that show what we've been up to, as well as a way to navigate those posts via our mailing lists for the folks that don't want to spend all day combing through our blog. :-)
