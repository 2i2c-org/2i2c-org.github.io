As we enter Q3 2025, our focus remains on enabling better cost controls for our communities and increasing flexibility for end-users. In line with our commitment to transparency, we’re sharing our platform and service objectives for the quarter and inviting feedback to ensure our direction reflects what matters most to the communities we serve. See our [product goals from the previous quarter here](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/q2-product-goals/).

The themes below offer a high-level snapshot of where we aim to evolve our offerings in the coming months.

## Demonstrable reliability of our infrastructure

Hub management has many moving parts, and things can go wrong. We want tighter control over the reliability of our infrastructure and better visibility into the status of our community hubs for administrators and members. We will take steps to improve **alerting**, **uptime**, and **overall platform reliability**, as well as review our internal **incident response practices**. Our goal is to improve the reliability and responsivity of our interactive computing hubs for both administrators and users throughout their community hub lifecycle.

## User-level costs monitoring and group-level usage monitoring

We'll build on our recent [Grafana dashboard usage monitoring](https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/aws-cost-attribution/) to add **usage monitoring for user groups** and begin work on **user-level costs monitoring**. These are steps toward group-level cost tracking, which will enable better management of team and departmental expenses, especially in large institutions.

## Improving our Incident Response capability

As a special-case of doubling down on infrastructure reliability, we're making a concerted effort to improve our incident response processes. This will allow us to respond more reliably and transparently to issues as they arise, and to give our communities confidence about the steps we're taking to resolve them. Our goal is to improve response time and quality, and connect this with infrastructure reliability improvements.

## Piloting a feature co-funding model

This year, 2i2c has experimented with a **collaborative community funding model for platform development**. This is a way to share funding across communities, and to invite community champions to co-fund projects on the 2i2c roadmap. Our goal is to accelerate upstream development with funded time while minimizing costs for each community. Over the next quarter, we’ll share more details on how the program works, how communities can participate, and what we're learning along the way.

**Early candidates for community funding:**

- **Compute quotas**: Building on our user and group management foundation, we aim to let admins assign compute quotas to users or groups, increasing cost control and easing departmental budgeting.
- **Canvas authentication**: Integrating with Canvas will enable management of users and groups within Canvas, while using the same data for usage and cost tracking.
- **nbgitpuller UX improvements**: Enhance nbgitpuller for sharing interactive projects via a simple link, focusing on error handling, conflict resolution, and per-user authentication for content retrieval.

As we develop this initiative, we’ll need to learn how to credit community partners who co-sponsor work and align our roadmap with the interests of the upstream communities we support.

If you have suggestions for improving this process, or if any features interest your community, [reach out to us](https://forms.fillout.com/t/uQHVMkgvsuus) to discuss joining other 2i2c communities in funding and accelerating their development.

## Another update coming in Q4

Each quarter, we’ll share an update like this to outline our product priorities and track progress. When planning for Q4, we’ll review what we’ve accomplished and provide a community update. Stay tuned!

Meanwhile, [let us know what you think](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1PXGM9_j0nyFLR1FEs7fz9x1vUuhs-J4IvoWGy5r-2aE/edit?fromCopy=true&ct=2) about our direction. Your feedback helps us provide the best value to our communities. Thank you!
