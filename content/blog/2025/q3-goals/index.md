As we move into the third quarter of 2025, our focus continues to be on enabling tighter cost management controls for our communities, as well as promoting greater flexibility for end-users. In line with our commitment to transparency, we’re continuing to share our platform and service objectives for the quarter, while inviting feedback and dialogue to ensure our direction reflects what matters most to the communities we serve. You can take a look at our [product goals from the previous quarter here](https://2i2c.org/blog/2025/q2-product-goals/).

While not set in stone, the themes outlined below offer a high-level snapshot of where we’re aiming to evolve our offerings over the coming months.

## Demonstrable reliability of our infrastructure

Hub management has a lot of moving parts, and things can and do go wrong from time to time. We want to ensure we have even tighter control over the reliability of our infrastructure, as well as visibility into the status of our community hubs for administrators and community members. We will enact a series of measures to improve alerting, uptime and overall platform reliability, as well as reviewing our internal incident response practices, to improve our communities' and their userbases' experience of their interactive computing hubs at all stages of the hub's lifecycle.

## User-level costs monitoring and group-level usage monitoring

We'll extend our recent work on monitoring [usage in Grafana dashboards](https://2i2c.org/blog/2024/aws-cost-attribution/) to extend **usage monitoring to user groups**, and also begin work on **user-level costs monitoring**. These will be incremental steps towards our goal of group-level costs monitoring, which will allow for better tracking of team and departmental costs, especially within large, complex institutions.

## Improving our Incident Response capability

Keeping our communities’ hubs running smoothly and responding to unpredictable issues in a timely and effective way is one of our highest priorities as an organisation. In Q3, we will build on our Q2 progress in streamlining and improving our service delivery (including onboarding, hub management and community enablement), and move on to review and improve our incident response processes. Our goal will be to improve our response time and quality, and connect this with improvements to the reliability of our infrastructure (described above).

## Piloting a feature co-funding model

This year 2i2c has experimented with a **collaborative community funding model for its platform development**. This is a way to share funding across communities, and invite community champions to collaborate in funding projects on the 2i2c infrastructure roadmap. Our goal is to accelerate upstream development with funded time, while minimising the cost to each community. Over the next quarter, we will share more details on how the program works, its goals, and how our communities can participate.

**A list of early candidates for community funding.** Here is an early preview of the features on our roadmap that are actively being considered for funding by communities in the 2i2c network:

- **Compute quotas**: building on our user and group management foundation, we're looking to add the ability to directly assign compute quotas to specific users and/or groups, greatly increasing cost control for large, complex user bases and easing the burden of departmental budgeting in large institutions.
- **Canvas authentication**: integrate Canvas authentication, allowing for the management of users and groups within Canvas while still being able to use the same user data for usage and costs monitoring and management.
- **nbgitpuller improvements**: improve the capability of nbgitpuller for the sharing of computationally interactive projects, in their entirety, via a simple link. These improvements will specifically focus on the tool's error handling, conflict resolution, and the enabling of per-user authentication for the retrieval of content.

As part of developing this collaboration initiative, we'll need to learn how to effectively credit the community partners that have co-sponsored this work, as well as how to align our own roadmap with the interests of the many upstream communities we support.

If you have thoughts on how we could improve this process, or if any of these features are of interest to your community, please [reach out to us](mailto:hello@2i2c.org) to discuss how you could join other 2i2c communities in funding and accelerating their development.

## Another update coming in Q4

Each quarter, we’ll share an update like this one to serve as an informal roadmap of our product priorities, aiming to make meaningful strides across the areas we’ve outlined. When we begin planning for Q4, we’ll look back at what we’ve accomplished through this effort and provide a progress update to the community. Stay tuned for more.

Meanwhile, [let us know what you think](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1PXGM9_j0nyFLR1FEs7fz9x1vUuhs-J4IvoWGy5r-2aE/edit?fromCopy=true&ct=2) about our direction. It takes less than a minute, and it really helps us make sure we’re providing the best possible value to our communities. We really appreciate your feedback!
