2i2c has successfully completed a hardware exchange with Universidad Nacional de Córdoba's [Centro de Computación de Alto Desempeño (CCAD)](https://supercomputo.unc.edu.ar/) through funding from the [Catalyst Project](https://catalystproject.cloud/). CCAD used funding to purchase new on-prem computing infrastructure, significantly expanding their computing capabilities.

This exchange reduces CCAD's reliance on ongoing cloud funding while giving them direct control over their infrastructure. The new hardware will support a scalable JupyterHub deployment and provide valuable training opportunities for researchers who may work with local computing resources.
