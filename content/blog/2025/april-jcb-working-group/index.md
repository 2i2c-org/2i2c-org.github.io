We're please to share that our People Operations Lead, [April Johnson](/authors/april-johnson/), has joined the [Jupyter Community Building Working Group](https://jupyter.org/governance/communitybuildingworkinggroup.html)!

This kind of work reflects how we think about [foundational contributions](../../2025/foundational-contributions/) and upstream support: strengthening the social infrastructure that helps open source communities grow and thrive, not just contributing code and running infrastructure. April brings deep experience building teams and communities, and we’re proud to support her upstream efforts in this way.

## Acknowledgements

- Thanks to the [Jupyter](../../../collaborators/jupyter/) Community Building Working Group for their leadership in building a stronger Jupyter community, and for welcoming April
