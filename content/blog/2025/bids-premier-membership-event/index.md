We're celebrating [BIDS (the Berkeley Institute for Data Science)](../../../collaborators/bids/) as 2i2c's first premier member at an event at UC Berkeley on **Thursday, October 15th**. If you're in the Berkeley area, we'd love for you to join us! [Event page here](https://events.berkeley.edu/BIDS/event/306419-ospo-monthly-meetup-launching-the-bids-membership-of-).

This is a milestone for 2i2c and demonstrates BIDS's commitment to open infrastructure and partnership. As our first premier member under our [new membership model](../../../join/), BIDS is helping us build a more sustainable path forward while strengthening our collaboration for shared impact in open science.
