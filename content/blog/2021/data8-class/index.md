[Data8](https://www.data8.org/) began as a large introductory data science class at UC Berkeley. It uses a Jupyter Book for all course materials, and uses JupyterHub magic links to distribute course content from the textbook.

2i2c is working with the Data 8 team to deploy JupyterHubs for community colleges in California that run the Data8 course, to make the infrastructure and content broadly accessible.

Giving people curricula, content, and infrastructure goes a long way to adoption. Communities want to remix content for their specific needs.
