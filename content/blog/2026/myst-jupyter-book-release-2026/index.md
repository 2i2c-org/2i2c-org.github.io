The MyST/Jupyter Book stack shipped new releases this week. Release pages:

- [mystmd 1.8.0](https://github.com/jupyter-book/mystmd/releases/tag/mystmd%401.8.0)
- [myst-theme 1.1.0](https://github.com/jupyter-book/myst-theme/releases/tag/myst-to-react%401.1.0)
- [Jupyter Book 2.1.1](https://github.com/jupyter-book/jupyter-book/releases/tag/v2.1.1)

Most of our contributions were foundational in nature - we fixed a bunch of bugs, did review on the PRs of others, and managed the release process itself.  Check out the changelogs for more details!
