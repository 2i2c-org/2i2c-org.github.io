Our teammate [Angus Hollands](../../../authors/angus-hollands/) gave a talk at FOSDEM 2026: [Introducing Jupyter Book 2](https://fosdem.org/2026/schedule/event/ZY9WYD-introducing-jb-2/).

The talk shares why the Jupyter Book 2 and MyST stack was rebuilt, and how it supports open, reusable computational publishing workflows.
