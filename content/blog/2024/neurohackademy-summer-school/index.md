2i2c are pleased to support the [Neurohackademy Summer School](https://neurohackademy.org/) in neuroimaging and data science again!

Following the success of our collaboration in previous years (see the [event page for 2023](https://escience.washington.edu/events/neurohackademy-2023/)), this year’s course will be held July 29th – August 10th, 2024 and will be hosted by the [University of Washington eScience Institute](http://escience.washington.edu/).

We provide an interactive computing platform for participants to get hands on experience in data pipelining, machine learning and data visualization techniques. Take a look at the following links to learn more about the neurohackathon:
