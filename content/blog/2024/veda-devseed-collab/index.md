The 2i2c team are proud to continue our strong working collaboration with [DevSeed](https://developmentseed.org/), following our previous work on the [US GHG center](/content/blog/2023/us-ghg-center-launches/). Together with scientists at NASA, we have recently delivered a tranche of improvements to [the Visualization, Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/esds/veda).

This platform is designed to thread open-source components together to consolidate GIS delivery mechanisms, processing, analysis and visualization tools, and presented in a collaborative interactive computing environment. All code repositories and associated resources stemming from this work are available on the [VEDA GitHub page](https://github.com/NASA-IMPACT/VEDA/wiki).
