[Spyglass](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab/spyglass) is a framework for reproducible and shareable neuroscience research produced by [Loren Frank’s lab](https://github.com/LorenFrankLab) at the University of California, San Francisco. They recently released a [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.01.25.577295v4.full.pdf+html) about their toolbox, and are using a 2i2c hub to provide accessible interactive cloud environments that demonstrate its functionality and helps researchers get started.
