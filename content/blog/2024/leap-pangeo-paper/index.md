Julius Busecke *et al.* of the [LEAP-Pangeo](https://leap-stc.github.io/intro.html)[^1] hub, have recently published a preprint[^2] that investigates "The Overlooked Sub-Grid Air-Sea Flux in Climate Models" using 2i2c infrastructure.

See Julius' [social media post](https://x.com/JuliusBusecke/status/1792930908900630735) for a more bite-sized outline of the work done.

Well done all! 🎉
