We are proud to announce that 2i2c has received financial support from [The Navigation Fund](../../../collaborators/navigation/index.md) to assist us in our mission to design and build a sustainable and scalable model for helping communities create and share knowledge with open infrastructure.

The award totals **~$1.5M over 2 years**. It provides support for several key strategic roles that are traditionally difficult to fund in a young organization: product management, delivery management, and business development. Here are the key goals this funding works toward:

- **Goal #1: Delivery**. Develop the operating structure and team skills to
efficiently scale our product and service delivery.
- **Goal #2: Product**. Develop a product system that continuously improves and
delivers value and impact at scale.
- **Goal #3: Sustainability**. Build a business model that is competitive and gives
us resources to sustain and scale our service.

We believe this is a critical step in helping our organization define and build a pathway to sustainability so that our service remains accessible, scalable, and resilient for years to come.

We're incredibly honored to be supported by the Navigation Fund, and excited to continue our work helping communities create and share knowledge with open infrastructure.
