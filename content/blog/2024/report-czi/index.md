We're pleased to share a three-year retrospective report that was created to close-out 2i2c's original [seed funding grant provided by the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](../../2021/czi-core-support/).

This report was written with the [new MyST Markdown document engine](https://mystmd.org) and shows off some of the functionality that we've been working on in collaboration with the MyST team.

We're incredibly grateful for the seed funding that CZI provided to kickstart 2i2c's mission and operations, and excited about more impact to come!
