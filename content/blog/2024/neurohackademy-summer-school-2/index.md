## Subsection


- What is NeuroHackademy? 
   -  A word or two about the hybrid structure (see also https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38763989/). 
- The role of 2i2c and the Jupyterhub in the NeuroHackademy curriculum. 
- Some features that we've honed over the years: 
    - nbgitpuller from an organization curriculum repo, with a ragtag team of instructors as collaborators.
    - Shared data storage with user read and admin read-write.
    - Emphasis on cloud-hosted datasets (and maybe a word or two about how much easier and abundant that has become!).
    - 
- This year's unique features: 
    - "Bring your own image" together with repo2docker and Github actions as a way to prototype changes to the image. 
    - Pull requests on 2i2c infrastructure. Organizers as GitHub collaborators. 
    - GPU instances. 
    
- Some lessons learned and desiderata for next year: 
    - jupyter keepalive for long-running processes.
    - ???
