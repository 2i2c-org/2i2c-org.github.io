We are proud to announce that 2i2c has received financial support from [The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/) to sustain our efforts at helping open science communities create and share knowledge with open infrastructure.

This builds upon [previous core support provided by CZI](../../2021/czi-core-support/), and provides an additional **~$700K over 1 year** to help 2i2c sustain its mission. We are incredibly grateful to CZI for their support, and this funding provides key runway for 2i2c to serve its community network and explore a sustainable and scalable model for impact.
