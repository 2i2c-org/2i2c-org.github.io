We are proud to announce that 2i2c has received financial support from [The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](../../../collaborators/czi/) to sustain our efforts at helping open science communities create and share knowledge with open infrastructure.

We invest in tools, platforms, and organizations that help expand participation and access to the scientific process by making it open and reproducible, and helping scientists build on each othersâ€™ work.'"

This builds upon [previous core support provided by CZI](../../2021/czi-core-support/), and provides an additional **~$700K over 1 year** to help 2i2c sustain its mission. We are deeply grateful to CZI for their support, and this funding provides key runway for 2i2c to serve its community network and explore a sustainable and scalable model for impact.
