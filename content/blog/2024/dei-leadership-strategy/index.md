All of the work we do here at 2i2c is founded upon the following open principles:

1. Transparency – our transparent and participatory model keeps our incentives aligned with community needs.
1. Empowerment – our service gives communities agency to design the service they need, and to manage it without 2i2c if they wish.
1. Partnership – our communities are partners working towards shared impact, not customers to grow revenue.
1. Sustainability – our service should have a self-sustaining model that ensures continuity, growth, and funder independence.

To truly deliver a service that broadens and empowers participation in open source science for all communities, we need a team embedded with diverse insights and lived experiences that can strongly advocate for under-represented voices in our socio-technical partnerships.

In the spirit of transparency, the leadership team at 2i2c acknowledge that we are lacking in this area. We recognize that there exists a worrying gender gap of women in leadership roles at this organization. We must do better.

Over the next few months, we will be working on a long-term DEI strategy in tandem with our sustainability strategy as we work [towards scalable and sustainable networks of community hubs](../funding-community-networks/index.md). In the short-term, we will make concrete steps to making diverse hires to our leadership team when more funding is available.
