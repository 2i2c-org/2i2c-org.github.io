Yesterday we had a quick "drop-in" session to take questions about 2i2c's [job posting for a Product and Community Lead](/blog/2022/job-product-community-lead).
We spent the hour discussing a number of questions that others had about the position.
Below is a short overview of the questions and some responses, for those who were not able to attend.
These responses are a bit rough, since they are mostly off-the-cuff based on the questions asked.

> ⚠️ We'll have a second drop-in office hours on **Thursday**. See the tweet below for details.

## What does success look like in the short and long term?

This is an important question, with a few different kinds of answers.

As noted, this is the first hire of its kind inside of 2i2c, and it should bring a strategic and organization-building eye to the work that it does.
To some extent, this role will be tasked with coming up with their own answers to these questions.
This person should build a near- and long-term strategy for how Product and Community Engagement should evolve to be most-effective in accomplishing our mission.
This will also mean defining goals and a strategy to meet these goals over time.

With that in mind, here are a few ideas we have in mind for goals that will drive this role:

**6 month goals** for this role might be:

1. Become familiar with 2i2c's organization, culture, mission, and team.
2. Define an early strategy for how you'd like to incorporate Product and Community engagement into 2i2c's operations, and set some Objectives or Key Results that we should use to measure success. This should include a plan for the two major objectives of this role: guiding and connecting with the communities we serve, and building design and planning processes that bring this perspective into our engineering and services.
3. A few iterations on the execution of this strategy, with some demonstration of impact as well as some documented lessons learned.

**2 year goals** for this role might be:

1. An organizational strategy and structure has been created, defining the various roles that make up this division of 2i2c and their functions.
2. Clearly defined team processes for major programs efforts that this role oversees, as well as interconnections with other major divisions of 2i2c (e.g. engineering or sales). For example, a framework for training community leaders and mechanisms or platforms for communication and engagement with our communities.
3. A team exists that carries out these efforts, led by the Product and Community Lead.
4. Clear demonstrated impact in the communities we serve, according to the OKRs and goals that have been set in this division.

## How does 2i2c provide mentorship/onboarding?

You can find [our onboarding process in our Team Compass](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/get-started.html).
This roughly comes down to choosing an "Onboarding Champion" for the new team member, to help walk them through our team processes and get them access to the right information and accounts.
However, 2i2c is quite young, so has only had a few iterations in onboarding new team members.
We look forward to improving this process further via this new hire.

## What are the largest challenges that someone might face in their first year in this position?

The largest challenge is largely related to ambiguity and fluidity of this role, due to the fact that 2i2c is small and relatively young.
As noted above, this position will have a great deal of autonomy, and will be expected to show leadership in defining the nature of this work within 2i2c.
This can either be exciting or scary depending on your comfort level with ambiguity!
We recognize that it is an anti-pattern to have roles without clearly-defined measures of success, so we're committed to defining this quickly in partnership with the new hire.
However, we don't want to be overly-prescriptive in this role, because we want it to have space to lead these efforts within 2i2c.

## How do you hope to protect the "business" aspects of 2i2c, if all the tech is open source?

2i2c is to some extent committing to a limiting business model: by respecting the [Right to Replicate](https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate), we *encourage* other organizations to perform the exact same kinds of services that 2i2c offers.
However, we believe this is in-line with 2i2c's mission, and would consider this to be a measure of impact rather than a sustainability problem.
In short: our goal is not to become a tech giant or start-up unicorn, we want to sustain a team with competitive pay, and we want to scale as there is more opportunity to serve new communities.
We believe that the complexity of integrating tools and managing cloud services means that there will always be enough of an opportunity to bring in ample funding for this model.
We also hope that our mission-driven nature and focus on research and education will bring in new kinds of funding opportunities that can sustain 2i2c and its mission.

## How would applying the "1000 true fans" approach work in terms of advocacy?

The [1000 true fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/) approach suggests that it is enough to leverage the support of "1000 true fans" to sustain a product or service.
We hadn't considered 2i2c in this light before, but believe it aligns well with our strategy.
A common pattern 2i2c follows is to build connections with "champions" in the communities that we wish to serve.
These individuals are passionate about open science, open source, and community-led workflows.
They advocate for 2i2c's services, and also serve as leaders for the kinds of workflows that 2i2c wishes to enable.
We believe that our mission-alignment with research and education, and our focus on empowering community leaders, will position us to build support and dedicated collaborators across these sectors.
We also hope that by centering Jupyter infrastructure in the services we offer, we can benefit from the recognition and demand for this ecosystem via our services.

## What challenges have you run into thus far?

There are many things we could respond with here!
In this meeting, we discussed two major challenges we continue to iterate on:

1. **Walking the line between "software as a service" and "custom infrastructure"**. 2i2c seeks to run infrastructure _on behalf of_ other communities, but in a scalable and sustainable way.
   This means that we must centralize configuration and deployment, but use a standardized stack that benefits from economies of scale.
   This is a complex problem, especially at the interface points with university bureacracies.
   For example, many universities require a _university email_ in order to manage cloud infrastructure in their organization - doing this for each of 2i2c's engineers is not a sustainable practice, and we must define creative ways to balance the security concerns of universities with our desire to run *their* infrastructure.
2. **Building a distributed organization from scratch**. The other major challenge we've faced is simply the act of creating an organization from the ground up.
   We have worked together for many years in open source communities, but there's a new degree of complexity when you're all working on the _same_ service and development efforts.
   Throw in a largely asynchronous team split across many time zones, and there are a lot of coordination and planning challenges to overcome.
   We have tried many things over the past year (see [our latest team practices in the team compass](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/practices/index.html), but there is still a lot of improvement to make.

## How crucial is a deep-seated knowledge of Jupyter for this role?

While it's not strictly required for somebody to have a knowledge of Jupyter, we think it will be an important part of this role (at least from a user's perspective).
This position is not an engineer, and won't be expected to understand the inner-workings of Jupyter's infrastructure.
However, it will be crucial that this role understand what is possible with JupyterHub, Notebooks, Jupyter Book, etc, and develop and teach best-practices in applying these tools for research and education.
They'll need to have a deep *intuition* for how to use Jupyter tools, how they should be improved, and how they can be integrated together for new services (along with other tools in the open source community).
More important than anything is a deep interest in this ecosystem, and a desire to learn, but having prior experience with the Jupyter stack and similar workflows will be a big benefit.
