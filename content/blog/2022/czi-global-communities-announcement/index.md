We are excited to announce that the team and proposal [described in this blog post](https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-global-communities-proposal/) has been awarded funding by the [Chan Zuckerberg Initiative](https://chanzuckerberg.com/)!

_This announcement may be cross-posted on the websites of several collaborating organizations of this grant. **Para leer este post en español, [vea el blog de MetaDocencia](https://www.metadocencia.org/post/infraestructura-nube/)**._

Our goal is to create a collaborative cloud infrastructure service that enables community-based cloud-native workflows in the biosciences. We will promote values of open and inclusive community practices, infrastructure that enables these practices, and a “train the trainers” approach that empowers community leaders to share expertise in cloud infrastructure with others in their communities. Our focus will be on communities in Latin America and Africa, and we hope to learn how this model could be extended to other global communities that are historically marginalized from large-scale scientific infrastructure projects.

2i2c will be providing cloud infrastructure operation and support for the communities that we partner with in this effort.
We will also assist with creating content to teach cloud-native workflows and assist community leaders in learning this content so that they can share these skills with others.

This is a collaborative effort between [2i2c](http://2i2c.org), [The Carpentries](http://carpentries.org), [CSCCE](http://cscce.org), [Invest in Open Infrastructure](http://investinopen.org), [MetaDocencia](http://metadocencia.org), and [Open Life Science](http://openlifesci.org). For more detailed information, see [the blog post with our full grant narrative](https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/czi-global-communities-proposal/).
