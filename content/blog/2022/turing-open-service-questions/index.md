# Three open questions for building open services

Over the past few weeks I've had an opportunity to brainstorm with members from [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/welcome) and [The Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/) about how 2i2c can refine is collaborative service model to be more impactful.
We recently had a day of brainstorming with [Malvika Sharan](https://github.com/malvikasharan), [Alden Conner](https://github.com/aldenc), [Hari Sood](https://github.com/harisood), and [Arielle Bennett](https://github.com/Arielle-Bennett).
One product that came out of this meeting was three important questions that we need to answer.
The reflect several major questions around creating community-centered services that strike the right division of labor and responsibility for each partner in the service.

Some of our discussions around this can also be found in [this GitHub Issue](https://github.com/2i2c-org/team-compass/issues/446).

## Where is the line between 2i2c and communities?

- We want to build spaces for communities to interact with us, but do not want communities to lose their own identity
- Example: communication forums
- How do we avoid colonizing them
- What if they don't have a pre defined community structure? Or are small? 
- When is it time for them to move on and create their own space?

## What can we ask of communities?

- We treat each hub as a collaboration
- We can provide infrastructure and guidance around it, but communities know what is best for themselves
- What can we ask of them in collaborating with us in the service? What subsets of people could take on more work than others? Post docs? Probably not PIs
- How can we support them in this? Could we provide suggested structure? Training via partnerships with non profits like cscce, openscapes, etc? Financial incentive for community members to step up? 
- What leadership is crucial that others in the community show what allowed Pangeo to thrive?

## How can we help communities help one another?

- We want to encourage communities to work openly
- Creating communication spaces that allow them to share and learn from one another
- Creating shared mentorship opportunities
- Creating shared documentation that allows them to collectively build a shared knowledge base
