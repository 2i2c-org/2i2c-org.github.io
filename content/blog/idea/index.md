We use our blog to [highlight the impact we've had](../2025/communications-strategy/index.md). 
Many of these ideas come directly from member and upstream communities! **We strongly encourage any of our collaborators to submit an idea for a blog post by clicking the button below**.

We want our blog posts to be short, direct, and low-effort (see our [blog guide](../../../contribute/blog.md) for guidance).
Time-box yourself at 2-3 minutes, don't worry if it isn't perfect!

If you'd like to fill in the template and share it via Slack or e-mail, that's fine too!
Here's a markdown block you can copy.
