# Our commitment to open technology

This page describes 2i2c's commitment to developing and contributing to infrastructure that is open source now and into the future. More context can be found [in this blog post](../blog/2025/community-ownership/index.md).

_Definitions of MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY, etc are defined in [RFC 2119](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2119)_

1. All engineering artifacts (code, documentation, etc) produced by 2i2c's engineering team MUST be licensed under an open source license approved by a non-profit organization that is not 2i2c.[^os-license]
2. Open Source Projects originating at 2i2c, or stewarded by 2i2c, MUST NOT require a [Contributor Licensing Agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) that includes Copyright Assignment to 2i2c. [^cla]
3. The list of external organizations that define licenses we accept are[^licensors]:
    1. [the Open Source Initiative](https://opensource.org/)
    2. the [Organization for Ethical Source](https://ethicalsource.dev/). 
4. Modifying (1), (2), or (3) MUST be done through a 2/3 majority vote of 2i2c staff. [^governance]

[^os-license]: This constrains us from writing proprietary engineering code or creating proprietary products. Note that this only applies to 2i2c artifacts, and not those that are created by our member communities.
[^licensors]: This constrains us from creating a new non profit that rubberstamps a license that is fundamentally proprietary, while still allowing for experimentation with licenses that try to innovate on OSI.
[^governance]: This sets an intentionally-high bar for modifying this policy. In 2025 we aim to re-establish our steering council along with a community advisory board that is tasked with defining policy like this. In the interrim, we choose `2/3 of the organization` to be a reasonably high bar for changing this policy
[^cla]: Protects from the most common "bait and switch" licensing problem, where being the sole copyright owner of a project allows us to change the license in the future because we've retained ownership over all the code.

These commitments ensure 2i2c's ongoing support for open source technology and community-owned infrastructure, and constrain us from _changing_ this commitment in a way that would harm our communities. We hope that this builds trust with our communities to rely on 2i2c as a provider and a steward of their infrastructure.
