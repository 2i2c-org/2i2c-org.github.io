All of the tools that 2i2c uses in its hubs are open-source and community-owned. A core mission of 2i2c is to give back to these communities by providing support, maintenance, and development. Below are a few tools and projects that we are particularly involved with, though the list of open source projects to which we contribute is much larger.
