The Hubs for Education pilot makes interactive computing environments more accessible to educational communities from smaller colleges and minority-serving institutions. It is a collaboration with [CloudBank](https://www.cloudbank.org/), and the [Berkeley Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society](https://data.berkeley.edu/dsep). 2i2c offers development and management of JupyterHub infrastructure geared towards educational use-cases, in partnership with these collaborators.
