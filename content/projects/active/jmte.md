The [Jupyter meets the Earth project](https://pangeo-data.github.io/jupyter-earth/index.html) combines research use cases in geosciences with technical developments within the Jupyter and Pangeo ecosystems. 2i2c collaborates with the Jupyter Meets the Earth Project by providing development around JupyterHub and Jupyter Book infrastructure, as well as assistance in running JupyterHub in the cloud.
