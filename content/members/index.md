title: Our member communities
---

This is a list of organizations with communities currently in our member network[^1]. Our members collectively support [2i2c's impact](../impact/index.md) with their resources. Each member gets one or more [community hubs run by our team](../platform/_index.md). Some have deeper collaborations with 2i2c, and our [collaborators page](../collaborators/_index.md) lists those that have contributed additional resources to our impact.
