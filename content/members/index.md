title: Our member communities
---

This is a list of organizations with communities currently in our member network, and a resource for community members to quickly find and access their hub URL[^1].

_Member organizations support [2i2c's impact](../impact/index.md) and our [commitment to open practices](../open-practices/index.md) with membership fees. Each member gets one or more [community hubs run by our team](../platform/_index.md). Our [collaborators page](../collaborators/_index.md) lists members that have contributed additional resources for [Directed and Foundational open source contributions](../blog/2025/foundational-contributions/index.md)._

[^1]: This is automatically generated using our community hub configuration data in [the 2i2c infrastructure repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure/). Clicking each logo will take you to the community hub for each community.
