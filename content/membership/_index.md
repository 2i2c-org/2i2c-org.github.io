      subtitle: Join a network of communities building shared open infrastructure
      text: |
        As a non-profit, we believe the best infrastructure comes from co-creation. Our membership model pools resources across research and education communities to operate [shared infrastructure](/platform) and to improve the [open source tools](/open-practices/#projects) everyone depends on.

        When you become a member, your community joins a network where usage shapes development priorities, improvements flow back to open source, and everyone benefits.

        {{< figure src="images/collaborative-model.png" alt="Diagram showing the collaborative model: member communities use their hub to have impact, they influence our open roadmap with feedback and co-funding, which drives contributions across the open source ecosystem, which creates better tools for our members and for the world." caption="Our collaborative development and operations model." >}}

        **Shared operations.** One infrastructure team manages hubs for all member communities using a [shared infrastructure repository](https://github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure). Each community gets their own hub customized to their needs, while benefiting from shared expertise, faster incident response, and improvements deployed everywhere at once.

        **Shared development.** Members influence [our open roadmap](https://2i2c.org/roadmap) with feedback and co-funding. This drives contributions across the open source ecosystem, creating better tools for the world and improvements that we can rapidly deploy to our member hubs.

      title: Membership and project work
      text: |
        We offer two ways to work together:

        **Membership** provides ongoing access to our managed hub platform. Membership fees sustain operations and support [foundational open source contributions](../blog/2025/foundational-contributions/) that benefit all members.

        **Project collaborations** let organizations fund specific development work that addresses shared challenges. Project work accelerates [our roadmap](https://2i2c.org/roadmap) and creates improvements deployed across the network.

        Many organizations do both: membership for day-to-day infrastructure, plus project funding for strategic priorities. See [our collaborators and funders](/collaborators) for examples of organizations we work with, or read more about [our service model](https://compass.2i2c.org/organization/service-model/).

        Your [Right to Replicate](/right-to-replicate) means you can take your infrastructure anywhere, with or without 2i2c. All our engineering work is [open source](/open-technology) with licensing that protects communities. We work transparently and [contribute upstream](https://2i2c.org/kpis/upstream/) to the projects we depend on.

        See [our public roadmap](https://2i2c.org/roadmap) for current priorities, or read more about [our open practices](/open-practices).
