Much of the work we do is supported by grants and donations from stakeholders in our community. These resources go towards things like **new development of open source technology**, **maintenance for open source projects**, **community development efforts**, **sponsoring hubs for under-resourced communities**, and **general support for 2i2c in its mission**.

Fill our the form below to make a donation to 2i2c via its fiscal sponsor, [Code for Science and Society](https://codeforscience.org). If you'd rather have a conversation with us first about your donation, please [send us an email](mailto:hello@2i2c.org?subject=Donation%20inquiry).
