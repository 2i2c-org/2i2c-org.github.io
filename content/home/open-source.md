In all of the work we do, we live [our values](/values) by collaborating with others, using and building open source infrastructure in partnership with communities, and creating technology that makes interactive computing more accessible and powerful for all.

Research and education will have a strong foundation of tools to use if those tools are supported by a healthy and strong ecosystem of open communities that create those tools. 2i2c supports many of these communities by investing our time and expertise to provide **core development support**, **community stewardship**, and **strategic support and leadership**.
