Our mailing list shares the most important information with our community, and is easier to keep up with than the [large number of blog posts we share](blog/2025/communications-strategy/index.md). Here's what to expect:

- Summaries of our contributions and impact over the past month.
- Announcements about the most important information from 2i2c.
- Announcements from the open source and open science communities.
- Guidance for how you can help our open science and open source network.
