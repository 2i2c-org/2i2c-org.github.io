[Invest in Open Infrastructure](https://investinopen.org), in collaboration with the [Joint Roadmap for Open Science Tools](https://jrost.org), awarded 2i2c a $5,000 rapid response grant to provide JupyterHub cloud infrastructure for research projects without cloud funding. Though modest in size, this grant provided early validation of 2i2c's community-centered approach.

Invest in Open Infrastructure helps funders and research institutions understand how to effectively support digital infrastructure, while JROST is a collaboration between funders committed to supporting open tools for science.
