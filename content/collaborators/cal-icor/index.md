[CAL-ICOR](https://www.cal-icor.org/) is a "Browser-based Interactive Programming and Data Science Platform for Every California Student". It gives educators and institutions a shared, scalable JupyterHub platform that removes hardware barriers, supports modern data science instruction, and expands access across the state.

From their website:

> The California Interactive Computing Open Resource (Cal-ICOR) initiative is a statewide effort to expand high-quality, accessible data science education across the University of California, California State University, and California Community College systems. Led by UC Berkeley and supported by the California Education Learning Lab, Cal-ICOR builds shared infrastructure, curriculum, and instructor support that lower the barriers to offering data-enabled learning, no matter the size, resources, or technical capacity of an institution.

> Our mission is simple: ensure that every student in California has access to the tools, skills, and learning environments that prepare them for data-rich careers and civic participation.
