[Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) is an educational working group that aims to provide a public, web-accessible training resource that will help educate current and future geoscientists to be more effective users of NCAR, university, and cloud computing resources. The project offers a wide range of open access content including datasets, software, tutorials, and annotated real-world workflows presented as Jupyter Books.
