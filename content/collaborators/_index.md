        _How we define types of collaborators_.

        **Members** are part of [our member network](../members/) that contribute extra funding and time. These are for contirbutions beyond the [Foundational impact](../blog/2025/good-citizen/) that membership fees support.
        
        **Funders** primarily have impact by funding initiatives that we benefit from. We include funders when they directly benefit 2i2c or a project on which we collaborate, but not every funder for every member and collaborator that supports us.
        
        **Collaborators** are non-members we collaborate with for shared impact. These are often themselves made up of many organizations and individuals working together. In general, we try to highlight multi-stakeholder collaborations rather than the individual organizations within them.
