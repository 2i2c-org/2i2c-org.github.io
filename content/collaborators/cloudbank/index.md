Cloudbank enables and provides "anaged Services to Simplify Cloud Access for Computer Science Research and Education".

In particular, the [CloudBank Classroom](https://www.cloudbank.org/training/access-cloudbank-classroom) project is driving a lot of collaboration with 2i2c via our shared work on JupyterHubs for education.
