# Information about our collaborators section

## Who is a collaborator?

- Any member that pays us extra for a specific contribution, feature, outcome, etc.
- Any large collaboration that we're funded on with a grant or ongoing contract.
- Any regular collaborate we directly work with towards one of our outcomes.
- Any funder who funds us beyond standard membership fees.

If large collaborations or projects have multiple participating organizations or funders, list them on the collaborator page.
