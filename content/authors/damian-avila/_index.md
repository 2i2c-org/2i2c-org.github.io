Father, Software Developer, Quant, (formerly) Biochemist, and some other things ;-)
Currently living between Córdoba and Buenos Aires, Argentina.
I have made some contributions to popular Open Source projects such as Jupyter, Nikola, and Bokeh.
I have also started several projects being RISE (a "live" slideshow for the Jupyter notebook) the most popular one.
You can easily find videos of some of my talks and tutorials at multiples national and international conferences.
How can I help?
