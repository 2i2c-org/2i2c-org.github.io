Chris is the Director of 2i2c. He was previously a post-doctoral researcher in the Department of Statistics at [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/), and a Community Architect with the [Division of Data Science](https://data.berkeley.edu/) at Berkeley. He is also a team member of Project Jupyter (particularly the [JupyterHub and Binder teams](https://jupyterhub-team-compass.readthedocs.io/en/latest/team.html#jupyterhub-team)), with a focus on how infrastructure can support interactive computing workflows in research and education. He's interested in the boundary between technology, open-source software, and research and education workflows, as well as how open communities can support and extend these workflows in a way that makes science more impactful and inclusive. His background is in cognitive and computational neuroscience, where he used [predictive models to understand the auditory system](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13654) in the human brain.
