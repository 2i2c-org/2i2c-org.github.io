I enjoy building and supporting communities of practice. I have built a small JS visualization library and dabbled in delivery management systems. Recently, I have strong interests in music (programming VST, etc.), AI and data science.

**Highlights**:

- 15+ years industry experience spanning companies in Africa and Jamaica
- 10+ years experience in agile consulting and coaching in technical and product teams
- Core skills span Enterprise Agile Coaching, Change Management, DevOps, and cloud consultations.
