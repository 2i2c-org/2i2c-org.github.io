James is Product and Community Lead for 2i2c. Coming from a background as an associate professor in the Department of Physics and Physical Oceanography at [Memorial University of Newfoundland](https://mun.ca), he is a strong advocate for enabling scientists and students to be efficient and effective in their computational workflows. Building on previous work in big data oceanography with links to the [Pangeo](https://pangeo.io/) project, [COSIMA](http://cosima.org.au/): Consortium for Ocean-Sea Ice Modelling in Australia, and [CIOOS](https://cioos.ca/): Canadian Integrated Ocean Observing System, James wants to bring the strength of the Jupyter ecosystem to users across a broad range of educational and research domains.
