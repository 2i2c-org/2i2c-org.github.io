The Managed JupyterHubs service is currently in a **private alpha** phase. We are running JupyterHub infrastructure for a select group of communities in order to learn more about how the service could best-support the communities we wish to serve. For more information, [see our strategy and goals documentation](https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/strategy.html).

We are prioritizing running infrastructure for a diverse group of organizations for both research and educational use-cases. In particular, we wish to serve institutions with limited resources or those from under-represented institutions.

Send us an email and we'd be happy to discuss your community's needs to understand if it is a good fit for our JupyterHub service.
