2i2c runs its cloud infrastructure openly, for anyone to see.
This helps [give our communities the Right to Replicate their infrastructure](/right-to-replicate), and makes it easier for others to collaborate with and learn from us.

- [**Our service overview**](https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/about/overview.html) has more information about the service, its goals and strategy, and the latest information on features, pricing, and use-cases.
- [**The hub administrator's guide**](https://docs.2i2c.org/en/latest/) is a hands-on guide for community leaders that administer JupyterHubs managed by 2i2c.
- [**Our Infrastructure Guide**](https://infrastructure.2i2c.org/) is the guide that _2i2c Engineers_ use to manage your cloud infrastructure. It describes all the details of our cloud infrastructure.
- [**Our Team Compass**](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/) has everything you might want to know about 2i2c - our structure, strategy, team practices and policies, major projects, and how to get involved.
