At the core of 2i2c's infrastructure are tools in [the Jupyter ecosystem](https://jupyter.org). Jupyter is an open community that builds tools that support interactive computing workflows with data. 2i2c's team members are core contributors in the Jupyter ecosystem, and leaders of several of its sub-projects. Jupyter's infrastructure is flexible, and can be used in partnership with a variety of open source tools.

We build on Jupyter and tools built by open communities for a few key reasons.

- **Powerful, flexible, and dynamic**. Open source tools are the best for accelerating research and empowering improving education.
- **Flexibility and freedom**. Open source tools run on many kinds of infrastructure and help you avoid vendor lock-in. You can run the entire 2i2c stack on your own if you wish!
- **Standards in data science**. Open source tools are the most-common toolchain across all research fields as well as outside of academia.
- **Align with your values**. Open source tools are controlled and owned by a broad and diverse community that is dedicated to the public good.
- **Accessible to all**. Open tools are free to use and deploy, making research and education more accessible to people around the world.
