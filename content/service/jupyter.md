At the core of 2i2c's infrastructure are tools in [the Jupyter ecosystem](https://jupyter.org). Jupyter is an open community that builds tools that support interactive computing workflows with data. 2i2c's team members are core contributors in the Jupyter ecosystem, and leaders of several of its sub-projects. Jupyter's infrastructure is flexible, and can be used in partnership with a variety of open source tools.
