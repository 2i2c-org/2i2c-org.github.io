2i2c is a mission-driven organization with the goal of supporting interactive workflows
in research and education, as well as open source communities that underlie the
infrastructure we deploy.

If you'd like to support 2i2c in this mission, we would love to talk. There are many
things that we can do with donations to ensure that your contribution is as impactful as
possible. Here are a few ideas:

- **Sponsor open-source engagement**. We commit to using only open source tools in all of its deployments, and to contributing back to these open source communities. This includes development as well as community support and leadership. Your donation to 2i2c can sponsor an engineer's time to engage more with open source communities.

- **Sponsor a 2i2c Hub**. We run [2i2c Hub infrastructure](/content/infrastructure/) for the research and educational communities. Running infrastructure takes both human and cloud resources, costs that we must pass on to our customers to sustain ourselves. Donations to 2i2c can cover our costs, allowing us to reduce the cost of 2i2c Hubs for particular organizations or communities.
