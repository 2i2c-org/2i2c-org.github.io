## Why 2i2c?

2i2c believes that open infrastructure is a crucial part of transforming research and education to be more powerful, more equitable, more inclusive, and more accessible. We are a small and growing team, and recognize that our early employees play a crucial role in setting the right culture and direction for the organization.

Here are a few reasons that we think 2i2c is a fantastic team to work with.

### Our values and our mission drive our actions üß≠

2i2c believes in weaving our set of core values into everything that we do, and that this will guide 2i2c in being as impactful as possible. As a member of 2i2c‚Äôs team, you‚Äôll have an opportunity to participate in [a community that believes in these values](/about), and tries to make the world a better place through living them every day.

### We have great team culture üôå

2i2c draws from experience in many large open source communities over the years. Because these communities operate fully remotely and strive to be as inclusive and participatory as possible, they must also strive to be more transparent and systematic in how they communicate, share information, and work. We are building a culture at 2i2c that follows these principles and builds upon them.

### We have competitive pay and great benefits üìä

2i2c believes that it's important for non-profit work to pay competitively with the tech industry. See [more information on our salaries and compensation](#salaries-and-benefits). We are also a remote-first organization with team practices that can be spread across the world.

### We support research and education üî¨

All of the work we do at 2i2c feeds into our mission: to support research and education through interactive computing infrastructure. Being a part of the 2i2c team means that each day you will spend your time building, operating, and supporting the infrastructure that powers data-driven discovery and learning.

### Open source communities are in our DNA ü§ù

All of the technical development that we do is open source, usually in partnership with other open source communities rather than controlled entirely by 2i2c. This means that the work you do with 2i2c will benefit a much broader community, and you‚Äôll be encouraged to connect with other open source communities as you do your work.

## Salary philosophy

We pay competitive salaries for all of our employees at SF market rates. 2i2c chooses its salary levels based on job title and discrete levels that correspond to experience. These salaries are fixed and consistent across all employees of 2i2c -- we do not pay different amounts based on geographic location or cost-of-living, you will be paid the same regardless of where you live. 2i2c also offers a generous benefits package, or will provide extra compensation if you are not in a position to take advantage of US-based benefits packages.

Why approach salaries in this way? For a few reasons. First, we don‚Äôt believe that people should have to take a large pay-cut just to work at a non-profit organization, and we want to hire competitively for the tech industry. Second, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We don‚Äôt believe that your ability to help 2i2c accomplish its mission is impacted by your ability to negotiate a better salary. We also don‚Äôt think it is impacted by external factors like your geographical location or cost of living. Third, we believe in transparency and openness when it comes to our salaries, in order to balance the amount of information on both sides of the hiring equation. We think that these practices allow 2i2c to hire competitively, equitably, and successfully.

## Benefits

For employees based in the US, 2i2c provides health benefits via its fiscal sponsor, Code for Science and Society (CSS).
These are administered by [TriNet](https://www.trinet.com)

For employees who are not based in the US, we will compensate you for similar benefits that apply to your country of residence. This is country-specific and generally entails a discussion about compensation that is fair and equitable compared with others at the same job level.

## Time off

The 2i2c team follows a "Don't ask, do tell" policy when it comes to taking time off.
We do not define strict restrictions about when people can take time off, and do not have a strict limit to the number of days that team members are away.
Instead, we ask team members to communicate their intentions early with one another, and discuss with the team if anybody has concerns that a person's absense will harm our ability to meet our goals.

As we are a distributed team across many countries, we do not differentiate national holidays from personal time off.
Instead, we recommend that everybody takes at least 40 days of time off each year, without a strict cap on the number of days.

More information about our time off policies can be found in the [Taking Time Off section of the team compass](https://team-compass.2i2c.org/en/latest/hr/time-off.html).
