## Who we are

2i2c is a non-profit organization with a mission to make interactive computing more accessible,
scalable, and powerful for research and education: [https://2i2c.org/mission/](https://2i2c.org/mission/).

We accomplish this mission by providing managed cloud services for interactive computing, by providing
development and technical leadership to researchers and educators that utilize this infrastructure for
specific communities, and by providing support for open source tools and communities in this ecosystem.

We have deep ties to the open source community and have been leaders and core contributors across dozens
of projects - in particular in the Jupyter ecosystem. We also have deep ties to research and education -
our team has spent years deploying infrastructure for universities, community colleges, and research teams,
and now we’re bringing this experience to a wider audience with 2i2c.

We believe strongly in communities that are inclusive, transparent, equitable, effective, and diverse,
especially 2i2c itself. We believe that our values should permeate everything about 2i2c, including the
work we do, the communities we serve, and our own organizational culture.

2i2c is a 501(c)(3) not-for-profit project fiscally sponsored by Code for Science and Society.


## What you’ll do

- Ensures the reliable operation of the 2i2c infrastructure (leveraging production-ready cloud-based
  tools such as JupyterHub, BinderHub, and Dask).
- Attends support-facing tickets
- Explores emerging technologies in the Cloud / DevOps space, design and implement cloud computing
  architecture in partnership with our team.
- Participates in upstream open source communities we rely on (such as JupyterHub, BinderHub, Dask, etc)
  in partnership with the established leaders of those communities and collaborate with the Community Lead
  in the education and outreach around cloud computing.
- Work with a distributed and global team - team members are given a lot of autonomy, and expected to be
  proactive at communicating with one another and working with others to allocate effort that will maximize
  our impact.


## Essential requirements

- Experience with deploying applications on cloud infrastructure.
- Experience deploying and developing with Linux container-based technologies, such as Docker and Kubernetes.
- Experience with continuous integration services (e.g. Circle CI, GitHub workflows).
- Experience developing tools in a general purpose programming language (eg. Python).
- Experience collaborating and coordinating work via online platforms, such as GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket,
  and distributed revision control.
- Experience working with distributed service teams that use asynchronous methods of communication
- Working hours that overlap with US Central and US Pacific time zones


## Desirable requirements

- Experience with major cloud providers.
- Experience in programming and software engineering with a track record of leadership in open, collaborative
  projects with broad community adoption.
- Experience working on geographically distributed open-source projects.    
- Experience with the Jupyter ecosystem and other tools for interactive computing.
- Evidence of existing connections and relationships in the worldwide ecosystem of open source software for
  data-intensive research and the ability to establish new ones.
- Experience with common data science methods, platforms, workflows, and infrastructures; with data management
  systems, practices, and standards; and the capacity to gain familiarity with new related topics.
- Experience engaging with highly technical researchers across a variety of methodological fields,
  research domains, and computational platforms.
- Experience building and maintaining continuous deployment pipelines.
- Interpersonal skills to work with researchers and students. Include having skills to communicate complex
  information in a clear and concise manner both verbally and in writing

## Final note

We are looking for engineers with working hours overlapping US Central and US Pacific timezones.
This is an essential requirement to resolve an existing imbalance in the team (most of our engineers
are located in European timezones). At this time, we will only review applications compatible with
that essential requirement.

Keep in mind we will begin reviewing applications around Oct 17th, and will accept them on
a rolling basis until the position is filled.

We are eager to receive your application!
