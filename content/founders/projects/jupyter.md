In addition to the services above, many 2i2c members have spent several years as
core [Jupyter Project](https://jupyter.org) maintainers. They have used their experiences in research and
education to improve core tools in infrastructure with [JupyterHub](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io), interfaces for
learning and research with the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io)
and [Jupyter Lab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io), and tools for
scholarship such as [Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org).
