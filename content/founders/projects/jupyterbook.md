[Jupyter Book](https://jupyterbook.org) is an open source project for building beautiful, publication-quality books and documents from computational material.
It facilitates scientific and technical communication with computational narratives, and builds on the open and modular components from the Jupyter ecosystem. Jupyter Book is stewarded by the [Executable Books project](https://executablebooks.org).
