[The DataHubs at UC Berkeley](https://ucbds-infra.github.io/ds-course-infra-guide/intro.html)
are a collection of JupyterHubs used across the
university's data science courses. These hubs serve thousands of students
across a variety of courses. 2i2c's team has helped build and maintain these
hubs, and also assists the university in integrating pedagogical content with
the datahubs and other Jupyter infrastructure.
