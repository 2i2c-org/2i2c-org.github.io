[Callysto](https://callysto.ca/) is a free, interactive, curriculum-based learning and skills development tool —
think “interactive textbook” — that can be accessed from any device with an internet
connection. It was created by Cybera and PIMS to help students strengthen their
computational thinking, coding, and data science skills. Callysto builds open education
resources and training programs for teachers and students in grades 5-12 that leverage a
cloud-hosted interactive computing platform.
