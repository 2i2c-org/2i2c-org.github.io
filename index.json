In this year we have grown, experimented, and accomplished a lot - we have also faced challenges and learned as a team. Our primary goal in 2021 was to build a strong foundation for 2i2c.\nTo reflect on our work thus far, we\u0026rsquo;re writing three blog posts that describe progress in major areas of work towards this foundation for 2i2c. These three areas are:\n Creating services for use-cases - these are our first managed infrastructure offerings for communities in research and education. Developing cloud infrastructure and tools - this is the technical backbone that makes these services possible, built entirely on open source tools. Building an organizational foundation - this is the creation of our team structures, processes, and culture that help us carry out our mission.  This first post will focus on services that we\u0026rsquo;ve created in our first year.\nUltimately, 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s mission is to facilitate use-cases in research and education via open source development and services. Throughout 2021 we ran several pilots to learn more about the needs of communities in research and education, and how we could build sustainable services that meet these needs. Here are some highlights for each major use-case we have targeted thus far:\nEducational community hubs A primary use-case that 2i2c seeks to enable is collaborative, distributed educational spaces for learning with data. In 2021 we ran several pilots with educational communities:\nA university-wide hub for the University of Toronto. This hub is used in a variety of classes throughout the university, and is made freely available to anyone with a UofT account. We hope to repeat this model for other university-wide communities, and have learned a lot about the challenges of working with particularly large educational communities.\nSeveral hubs for community colleges across California. In partnership with UC Berkeley and CloudBank, we\u0026rsquo;ve run several hubs for nearly a dozen small community colleges teaching the Data 8 curriculum for their students. These hubs are lightweight and offer standardized environments for their students to use, in order to lower the cost of deploying and maintaining the hubs over time.\nWhat we learned The organizational context around educational use-cases is different from research communities. Compared with research groups, educucational groups have more variance in their size (classes as small as 10 people and as large as 500) and think about cost by the student, not as a lump sum. This means that our initial hub-based pricing model may not map cleanly onto educational contexts, and we need to improve the match of scalability and price to these communities.\nMoreover, we\u0026rsquo;ve learned that for these communities, navigating all of the open source tools that are available for pedagogy is confusing! Everybody wants auto-grading but it\u0026rsquo;s unclear what is the \u0026ldquo;right tool for the job\u0026rdquo;. Tools like nbgitpuller have heavy use at \u0026ldquo;power universities\u0026rdquo; like UC Berkeley, but many others don\u0026rsquo;t know that it exists! We will need to invest more time into building guides and documentation that help others leverage these tools.\nResearch in the cloud In addition to educational use-cases, we ran several pilots for research communities in order to leverage cloud infrastructure for scaling their work or collaborating more effectively.\nWe migrated Pangeo’s cloud infrastructure to be run via 2i2c. The Pangeo Community had been operating and developing their own JupyterHub for several years, but were looking for another organization to provide more reliable/sustained operations and support for their Pangeo Cloud Service. This year we migrated the service to run off of 2i2c’s deployment infrastructure.\nA scalable cloud hub for a SWOT satellite team. The MEOM research group at Grenoble is doing work with the NASA SWOT satellite project. However, the datasets generated from this project are huge, and only storable via the cloud. We\u0026rsquo;ve set up a JupyterHub to provide cloud-based access to this data, running a Pangeo-like environment.\nWhat we learned Research communities tend to have more usecase-specific needs than educational ones. While introductory courses in data science tend to be similar across institutions, research needs are much more unique to the problem and team at hand. Moreover, they tend to want infrastructure that runs via institutional cloud accounts. This is possible due to the flexible nature of Jupyter and JupyterHub, but brings extra challenges in bureacracy and access permissions, given that 2i2c engineers usually are not members of these organizations already.\nAdditionally, many research use-cases are based around the location of the data. This is because data is the hardest thing to move from cloud to cloud. For this reason, it\u0026rsquo;s important to bring interactive sessions to the data. Jupyter\u0026rsquo;s ecosystem makes this possible, but we\u0026rsquo;d like to do more to make this easier. For example, users should be able to launch interactive sessions across many clusters or datacenters, regardless of their hub\u0026rsquo;s location. They should also have more customized control over their environments.\nDistributed events and hackweeks Finally, we had a special use-case that is a hybrid of the previous two examples. Events and hackweeks are time-bounded, focused on learning and doing, but often with research workflows and communities. They also tend to be more globally-distributed than a traditional research or education community. See below for a few examples:\nThe Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana workshop is a summer school run in Ghana to share skills and workflows with researchers across Africa. It builds on workflows in the Pangeo ecosystem, and teaches attendees how to work with cloud-native data. By using a cloud-based JupyterHub for their workshop, attendees had direct access to data and compute in a way that would have been much more difficult to set up on local infrastructure.\nThe PaleoHackWeek hackathons were two hackathons around paleo/climate data workflows. They brought together a distributed community and use the 2i2c hub to facilitate the use of the paleoclim package throughout the hackweek.\nOpenScapes champions open practices in environmental science to help uncover data-driven solutions faster. They have several cohorts of scientific trainees learning more about adopting open and collaborative workflows, and use a hub managed by 2i2c to provide remote learning environments for their workshops.\nWhat we learned Initially we assumed that event-based hubs would be similar to educational use-cases. However, in practice they are more complex. First, event organizers have ever-changing communities of users on their hubs. They often want to provide access to many new users in each event, and expect only a small subset to continue using the infrastructure after an event. Finally, one-off events also generate spikes in activity that are more intense than educational use-cases, and warrant more dedicated attention from our engineers.\nChallenges that we faced As we piloted these use-cases, we also ran into a few challenges in designing services around our infrastructure.\nBalancing standard deployments, custom deployments, and scalability. Our goal is to centralize our deployment and operations infrastructure in order to reduce the maintenance burden for each community hub. This will allow us to gain economies of scale and lower costs. However, there’s an inherent tension between scalability and customizability - in order to scale we must standardize the infrastructure we offer, but communities often want environments that are unique to their use-case.\nTurning services into sustainability. We’ve learned that charging money for things does not come naturally to us. We’ve spent many years building technology and services that were offered freely to the public. This was easy to provide, but difficult to sustain. 2i2c’s goal is to offer similar services, but with a sustainability model that allows us to employ team members to do this work, and to grow in the future. Understanding how to pair the right technology, use-case, and service with a particular pricing model is an area where we must learn more.\nWhat’s next Piloting all of these services taught us a lot about the similarities and differences between each use case. Towards the end of 2021, this led to 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s first collection of \u0026ldquo;service offerings\u0026rdquo; for a Managed Jupyter Service. This includes a 2-by-2 matrix of service options, and a specific price point for each. We have begun offering this service to communities, in order to learn more about the model, the pricing, and any changes that should be made. In early 2022, we hope to expand this group to more communities so that we can test this model’s ability to scale.\nOur next post in this series will focus on the underlying technology that powers the services described above, stay tuned for more!\n","date":1643068800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643068800,"objectID":"44c06eac6c9f88c9f707642e2769fd4d","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/posts/2022/2021-review-services/","publishdate":"2022-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2022/2021-review-services/","section":"posts","summary":"Now that 2021 has come to an end, this marks the end of 2i2c’s first year of operations.

We have recently finished re-creating the Pangeo community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the 2i2c-org/infrastructure repository. This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.\nFor users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one! The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community. It will be available at the same URL (https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io) and there\u0026rsquo;s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place. Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work. Please see this Discourse thread as an initial place to provide feedback.\nOn 22nd November 2021, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub. Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!\nHistory of Pangeo Cloud Hubs Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.\nThe first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the 2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs. This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable. Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.\nIn the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure. However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed. Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.\nThe Pangeo-2i2c Partnership 2i2c is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows. We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem. We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.\nSimilarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities. Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project\u0026rsquo;s technical stacks.\nWe\u0026rsquo;ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo\u0026rsquo;s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities. We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this kick-off thread on Discourse. This approach allows each community to focus on it\u0026rsquo;s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo\u0026rsquo;s workflows. In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c. Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community. We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.\nWe are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! 🚀\n","date":1637020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637020800,"objectID":"387cb5d1ac5749bf565782c6a848ff2b","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/pangeo-goes-live/","publishdate":"2021-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/pangeo-goes-live/","section":"posts","summary":"2i2c are pleased to announce that the first Pangeo JupyterHub is now live on 2i2c-operated infrastructure! :tada: ","tags":["2i2c","pangeo"],"title":"Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!","type":"posts"},{"authors":["Chris Holdgraf"],"categories":["updates"],"content":" This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we\u0026rsquo;ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we\u0026rsquo;re up to next. In addition, almost all of the work we do is public and discoverable across our GitHub repositories, and is tracked by GitHub issues. Here\u0026rsquo;s a list of issues we\u0026rsquo;ve closed in ~Q3.\n It is amazing how quickly 4 months goes by when you\u0026rsquo;re building an organization from scratch! It seems like only a few weeks ago that we were recapping the beginning of the year in our last community update. Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.\nThere are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we\u0026rsquo;ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We\u0026rsquo;ll cover major highlights, challenges we\u0026rsquo;ve faced, and where we\u0026rsquo;re going next.\nHighlights Managed JupyterHub Service Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we\u0026rsquo;ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.\nWe focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:\n Automation across cloud providers. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we\u0026rsquo;ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on AWS as well as Azure to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales. Monitoring and reporting infrastructure. We have worked on the JupyterHub grafana-dashboards project to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs. User environment management. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we\u0026rsquo;ve improved the repo2docker GitHub action to work with more image registries, and created a 2i2c user image template repository for users to re-use for their hubs. See the User Environment docs for more information. Support and collaboration roles. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the community representative role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See the user roles documentation for more information. We have also begun prototyping a FreshDesk support model and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents.  Pangeo We are working with the Pangeo Community to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the \u0026ldquo;old\u0026rdquo; Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work in this GitHub Project.\nExecutable Books / Jupyter Book We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the Executable Books Project. As such, we have begun shifting our attention to create a strategy for sustaining the project\u0026rsquo;s community beyond this grant. In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.\nJupyterHub community support We recently collaborated with the JupyterHub community to apply for two CZI EOSS awards. Last month, we were notified that our application to support a Community Strategic Lead was funded! This role will fund Sarah Gibson\u0026rsquo;s time to focus some of her thinking on building community structures and dynamics that are inclusive and sustainable. We\u0026rsquo;ll update with more information as this project starts moving.\nOrganizational foundations Finally, in addition to our major development and projects, we have also made a lot of progress at an organizational level.\nWe began a fiscal sponsorship with Code for Science and Society. This provides a new organizational and legal home for 2i2c after spending nearly a year receiving critical strategic and start-up support from our previous host, ICSI. We are excited to work with CS\u0026amp;S to create the business infrastructure that will power our managed JupyterHubs service.\nThe 2i2c team has also been improving our team planning and coordination processes, so that we can more effectively execute on our mission. As a distributed team, we have the challenge of building processes for team communication, coordination, and planning that are distributed and asynchronous. If you\u0026rsquo;re curious, you can learn more about our coordination processes in our Team Compass.\nWe have improved our organization-wide documentation in order to make it easier to navigate between 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s various sources of information. We hope that this provides more transparency into what 2i2c is up to and how it is structured, and that it allows us to build more connections between our projects and the broader community. Check out the new documentation landing site at docs.2i2c.org.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next In addition to making iterative improvements around the projects described above, we have a few major goals for the final quarter of 2021.\nWe wish to polish and finish the alpha-level deployment infrastructure across each of the major cloud providers. Our end goal is to be able to deploy a Kubernetes cluster and a JupyterHub on that cluster with minimal human effort. This will allow us to serve more communities with fewer human effort per community. This includes migrating JupyterHubs for key communities, such as the Pangeo project.\nWe wish to define and begin an alpha-level service. This means defining a few specific \u0026ldquo;products\u0026rdquo; that 2i2c can offer, as well as a pricing model for each product. Our goals will still be to learn about how this service should evolve, but we\u0026rsquo;ll have a bit more specificity about ways that others can engage with us. It will also be an opportunity to scale modestly so that we can improve our infrastructure as-needed.\nWe wish to define a longer-term vision for our Managed JupyterHubs Service, and create a plan for new workflows that we wish to enable via new development. We wish to use our experience in managing JupyterHubs to understand where new open source development would significantly help the communities we serve, and will shift our attention in this direction once we have finished the early stages of making our infrastructure more robust.\nStay tuned for some more updates about this service, coming soon!\nChallenges we\u0026rsquo;ve faced Finally, we want to recognize that there are plenty of challenges along with successes when it comes to having impact! Here are a few of the unexpected challenges that we\u0026rsquo;ve faced along the way.\nDeveloping and operating multi-cloud infrastructure is a complex process. Automating the creation and operation of Kubernetes clusters across each of the major cloud providers has proven to be a lot of work! While it has been necessary to use our pre-existing hubs to provide the opportunity to build this infrastructure, it is a challenge to both build and operate infrastructure at the same time. This has lengthened our timelines for when we expect the alpha version of the service to be ready.\nCoordinating among a distributed team takes time. Each of our team members has been used to working asynchronously with open source communities for many years, and we under-estimated how complex it would be to port this workflow to a distributed team that must coordinate with each other much more closely on a daily basis. Deciding what to work on, how to work on it, and how to help one another take a lot of work when you only share a few hours awake at the same time. For this reason, we have spent a lot of extra energy in our first months as a team to work out team processes for coordination and collaboration.\nHow to design cloud services as a non-profit? Finally, we\u0026rsquo;ve learned that there is no clear roadmap for how to build a sustainable cloud service like the one we describe here. 2i2c is somewhere in-between a traditional SaaS company (which tends to provide access to proprietary technology) and a bespoke consultancy (which is more hands-on and custom than we are). Our best explanation for what 2i2c wishes to do is \u0026ldquo;Open source operations/dev-ops as a service\u0026rdquo;, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t quite fit into either category. This means that we have more \u0026ldquo;unknown unknowns\u0026rdquo; about what kind of service and pricing model we should develop. We hope to begin answering some of these questions in our alpha-level service launch. Stay tuned for more to come!\nGet involved Thanks for your interest in 2i2c and the mission that it hopes to accomplish. We hope that this update has been informative and interesting, and we welcome feedback about any of the information provided.

After spending a year incubating in the International Computer Science Institute, where 2i2c received critical startup support, 2i2c now joins our fiscally sponsored project program to launch their next phase. 2i2c develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing, with a focus on the Jupyter ecosystem and cloud-native workflows in research and education. They will build a cloud services model that respects a community’s Right to Replicate their infrastructure by providing transparent and customizable JupyterHub deployments on cloud infrastructure that utilize community-driven open source tools. They aim to use the resources generated from this service in order to support the communities that underlie this infrastructure. Read on for more about 2i2c’s mission and how CS\u0026amp;S will support their team and vision.\n2i2c’s organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2c’s co-founders have co-led for many years, including the Pangeo Project, the Syzygy Project, the Binder Project, and the UC Berkeley DataHub. These projects follow an “integrate, customize, and upstream” model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.\nCS\u0026amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS\u0026amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS\u0026amp;S’s other initiatives in this space, including CS\u0026amp;S’s other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the Digital Infrastructure Incubator program.\nAchieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2c’s next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2c’s developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.\nIf you believe that your community would benefit from a hub like this, please reach out to the 2i2c team, or join their mailing list. Stay tuned as 2i2c builds its sustainable, scalable, and community-driven platform for interactive computing in the cloud.\n","date":163296e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":163296e4,"objectID":"01b3ec17ba343cfa024b704f654f8451","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/css-announce/","publishdate":"2021-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/css-announce/","section":"posts","summary":"This post was originally written for the CS\u0026amp;S blog.\nCode for Science \u0026amp; Society is thrilled to welcome the International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project!","tags":["2i2c"],"title":"2i2c launches next phase in partnership with CS\u0026S","type":"posts"},{"authors":["Damián Avila"],"categories":["development"],"content":"","date":1630713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630713600,"objectID":"89a5d958fa87f1148b73d4287843ab52","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/myst-nikola-part-2/","publishdate":"2021-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/myst-nikola-part-2/","section":"posts","summary":"","tags":["jupyter","executablebooks"],"title":"A deep dive into MyST, Part 2: The MyST-Parser, Docutils and Sphinx","type":"posts"},{"authors":["Damián Avila"],"categories":["development"],"content":"","date":1629676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629676800,"objectID":"20993712705d326847182341cb894429","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/myst-nikola-part-1/","publishdate":"2021-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/myst-nikola-part-1/","section":"posts","summary":"","tags":["jupyter","executablebooks"],"title":"A deep dive into MyST, Part 1: The MyST-Parser Python API usage in Nikola","type":"posts"},{"authors":["Chris Holdgraf"],"categories":["organization"],"content":"It has been about six months since 2i2c first began operations (after receiving funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative). In that time we\u0026rsquo;ve made progress along several directions, and wish to use this blog post to provide updates about the ways in which 2i2c has evolved over the first months of its existence.\nBelow are a few major updates from the 2i2c community - as always, if you want to learn more about 2i2c, keep an eye on our blog or subscribe to the 2i2c mailing list.\nEarly pilot JupyterHub infrastructure First off - we have been making progress building out our JupyterHub deployment infrastructure for 2i2c. One of our major organizational goals is to build a sustainable service managing open source cloud infrastructure for interactive computing. This service will provide hosted, customized JupyterHubs for communities of practice in research and education. They\u0026rsquo;ll be built entirely with open source tools that are community-driven, and that respect the customer\u0026rsquo;s Right to Replicate.\nIn order to accomplish this, 2i2c is running several pilots with partners and interested organizations, supported by our funding from CZI, as well as from the JROST rapid response fund. These pilots are meant to be learning opportunities to understand what kind of infrastructure and service it needs to build moving forward.\nThe documentation for our pilot hubs infrastructure contains information about our deployments and infrastructure. It is served from this 2i2c-org/infrastructure repository, a centralized location for configuring and deploying a federated network of JupyterHubs. Each JupyterHub is independent of one another, and could be spun out from the centralized repository with minimal extra work, giving hub users the ability to replicate their infrastructure, with or without 2i2c. We will continue refining the code in this repository as we learn more from our hub infrastructure pilots.\nJupyterHub for geospatial analytics - A collaboration with Pangeo As originally announced on the Pangeo blog, 2i2c is forging a collaboration with the Pangeo project around operating and developing cloud infrastructure for large-scale geospatial analytics! This collaboration is funded through a grant from the Moore Foundation (via Pangeo investigator Ryan Abernathey).\nOver the coming months, 2i2c plans to assume operation of infrastructure underlying the Pangeo project, allowing the Pangeo team to focus their efforts on their core scientific and development missions. Because Pangeo\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure is already running on a fully open source stack with JupyterHub, our first step will simply be to shift control over this infrastructure to 2i2c engineers. We don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate needing to make major changes to their infrastructure and deployments (part of the benefits of using open, modular tools).\nOnce this is complete, we\u0026rsquo;ll next shift our attention to some new areas of development that support use-cases in the Pangeo community (and in the scientific community more broadly). There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of progress that we imagine making - such as supporting publishing pipelines via the Pangeo Gallery or improving tools for scalable computing with Dask Gateway. We\u0026rsquo;ll provide updates as we formally begin this collaboration and hash out a plan for our next steps.\nJupyterHub for education - A collaboration with CloudBank and UC Berkeley In addition, we\u0026rsquo;ve begun a partnership with the UC Berkeley Data Science in Undergraduate Studies program, as well as CloudBank. This collaboration aims to provide hosted JupyterHub infrastructure for community colleges across the state of California. It is an attempt at providing vendor-agnostic and open-source infrastructure to several institutions who would otherwise not be able to deploy this infrastructure on their own.\n2i2c will provide the deployment and configuration architecture for this collaboration, working with Sean Morris in operating this educational infrastructure. All of the cloud infrastructure for this pilot will be funded via CloudBank. We will begin by offering environments that are modeled after the Data 8 course at UC Berkeley. This is part of an effort to build a community of practice around Data Science education using open source tools.\nNew team members We\u0026rsquo;ve also welcomed two new members to the 2i2c core team! 🎉\nThese individuals will both work towards 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s major projects, and collaborate together on running our 2i2c Pilot Hub infrastructure. Here\u0026rsquo;s a bit about each new team member.\n Damián Avila. Damián has been a Jupyter core team member for many years now, and has done work across many different parts of the PyData stack (in particular, Jupyter, Bokeh, RISE, and Nikola). Damián will focus his efforts on supporting JupyterHub infrastructure for the Pangeo project, as well as development across the Executable Books Project Sarah Gibson. Sarah will join 2i2c in June, after spending several years as a Research Software Engineer at the Turing Institute. She has also been involved with the Turing Way for many years. Sarah will focus her efforts on JupyterHub development and operations for the Pangeo community.  Governance and a code of conduct Finally, while it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get lost in technology and collaborations, 2i2c has also made important steps towards defining a stable and transparent organizational model moving forward. 2i2c now has a Steering Council and an early organizational structure. In addition, we\u0026rsquo;ve defined a one-year bootstrap strategy that we\u0026rsquo;ll use to guide our path in the first year of 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s existence.\nFinally, one of the first acts of the Steering Council has been to adopt a Code of Conduct. This is a set of guidelines, and a process for resolving incidents, that makes our community more inclusive, equitable, and enjoyable for all. Creating a Code of Conduct is a crucial part of defining our organizational and community culture, and we\u0026rsquo;re excited to have some explicit guidelines to support our interactions in the future!\nKeep in touch Now that we are improving our organizational foundation, we will try to post more frequent updates and discussions about what we are up to. We hope for 2i2c to be a model organization in participatory, collaborative, transparent operations, and we look forward to working with you all in the future on this journey.\n","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621900800,"objectID":"aaa9d8607a9ab55b6609dfb7578ca344","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/six-month-update/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/six-month-update/","section":"posts","summary":"It has been about six months since 2i2c first began operations (after receiving funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative).

Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. You can find CZI\u0026rsquo;s announcement here.\nThis funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨\nThe rest of this post is a short run-down of what we\u0026rsquo;ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.\nThe big picture In recent years, several projects including Binder, Pangeo, Syzygy, and the Berkeley DataHubs have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.\nIn order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.\nBelow are two keys goals for this grant:\nGoal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter\u0026rsquo;s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support Chris Holdgraf to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.\nWe are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.\nGoal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education 2i2c will offer hosted interactive computing infrastructure utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s first hire - Georgiana Dolocan as an Open Source Infrastructure Engineer. Georgiana has been the JupyterHub Contributor in Residence for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!\nGeorgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.\nThis is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with an outreachy internship followed by a term as Contributor in Residence. Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and NumFOCUS for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the CZI EOSS grant series for funding the original Contributor in Residence.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its JupyterHub pilot deployments to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please reach out to 2i2c and let us know!\nMany thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally. We also believe it will lead to major advancements in supporting interactive computing workflows for research and education. We look forward to what the next three years will bring!\n","date":1605744e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605744e3,"objectID":"011390bc3a97740cd41789ab12ff32e9","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/posts/2021/czi-core-support/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/czi-core-support/","section":"posts","summary":"Last week we announced the creation of 2i2c, a non-profit initiative dedicated to improving and facilitating access to infrastructure for interactive computing workflows in research and education.

It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.\nThis is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out this talk about 2i2c at JupyterCon 2020:\n  Why create 2i2c? The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including bringing data science education to thousands of students, connecting geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud, and providing federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada, to name a few.\nOver time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.\nWe created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that development and support of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.\nWhy a non-profit? It may sound strange to create a non-profit initiative when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:\n Research and educational communities, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source. Researchers and educators who need development, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that offers development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud. Open source communities, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy. Cloud providers, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure. Supporters of open source who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission.  As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.\nWhat are we going to do? With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here\u0026rsquo;s a rough picture:\nOffer hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure. These will be entirely open source and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They\u0026rsquo;ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see the 2i2c Right to Replicate document.\nProvide collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education. Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community\u0026rsquo;s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.\nProvide core development and community support for open source projects that we use. While many organizations use Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they give back to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.\nNext steps 2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months. Here\u0026rsquo;s an idea of what we\u0026rsquo;ll be up to next.\nOur first step is to understand how interactive computing can best-serve the research and education communities. We know that interactive computing tools work in our specific use-cases, but how do these generalize to other domains or types of organizations? Moreover, how can we improve the open source tools to make them even more customizable for each community?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll begin answering this question through several focused JupyterHub pilots aimed at different use-cases across research and education:\n A \u0026ldquo;Hubs for All\u0026rdquo; pilot for education. This will focus on making standard educational environments via JupyterHub accessible to a broad range of educational institutions, in particular, traditionally under-resourced institutions such as community colleges, state colleges, and HBCUs. Research-focused hubs for earth analytics. Research requires more complex and customized infrastructure than education, and so we are piloting hub infrastructure for a few specific research communities to understand how we can meet their needs. We will use this to better-understand how 2i2c and support a diverse research community in the future. JupyterHub development for the Pangeo Project. Pangeo has been a collaborator of 2i2c since day one, and we love its vision for large-scale earth analytics via cloud infrastructure. We plan to work closely with Pangeo leadership to work on early development of tools aimed at facilitating scalable computing for research on Pangeo infrastructure. More information about this to come soon.  We\u0026rsquo;ll also use these pilots to develop an organizational sustainability model around this infrastructure. It takes expertise to manage and develop cloud infrastructure, and 2i2c wishes to pay market rates for its engineers. How can 2i2c offer services and development in a way that is sustainable both for itself and for other institutions? We\u0026rsquo;ll use these pilots to create a plan for both sustaining and scaling 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s ability to serve institutions and teams.\nWhat do we need? As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c has a long road ahead of it. We cannot take venture capital funding, so we have to raise funds the old-fashioned way. This means that:\n If you are at an organization interested in purchasing hosted JupyterHub environments from 2i2c, please send us an email . If you are a funder or are otherwise interested in supporting 2i2c with a donation or grant, please send us an email . If you have experience in sustaining service-based organizations such as 2i2c, and wish to offer your expertise or guidance, please send us an email .  Moreover, we\u0026rsquo;ll likely be hiring in the coming months for open source engineers, with a focus on data science, interactive computing, and the cloud. If you\u0026rsquo;re interested in working for an organization like 2i2c, please send us an email , and keep an eye on this space as we will post more information soon.\nGet involved If you\u0026rsquo;d like to get involved with the 2i2c team and community, we recommend two pathways for doing so.\nSubscribe to our mailing list. We\u0026rsquo;ll use this to periodically send updates about what 2i2c is up to.\nJoin the 2i2c Slack. We use Slack for team conversation, as well as for real-time conversations about tools, practices, and ideas around interactive computing for research and education.\nYou can also say hello to us on Twitter at @2i2c_org.\nWrapping up We are excited about 2i2c, and believe that it is the right kind of organization to create to support research and education, as well as open source communities in interactive computing. The road ahead is a difficult one, but we\u0026rsquo;re confident that we will hit our stride quickly. Stay tuned for more updates to come.\n  EDIT 08-2021: We are now a fiscally-sponsored project of Code for Science and Society and ICSI is no longer our host organization. We are leaving this section here for archival purposes, and to give credit to ICSI for their help in launching 2i2c. 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s host organization is the International Computer Science Institute, a 501(c)(3) charitable organization.

It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.","tags":["meta"],"title":"Hello World","type":"posts"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Right to Replicate gives customers the right to replicate their infrastructure in its entirety elsewhere, with or without 2i2c.\nThis document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a customer’s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c. We make these commitments because we believe that using infrastructure that follows these principles will lead to a more fair, just, equitable world. We also believe they are the right foundation for more productive and impactful research and education.\n2i2c is committed to running its own infrastructure on open-source tools and vendor-agnostic infrastructure, though it does not force users to use only open-source tools in their own environments, code, and data. Below is a table describing how the Right to Replicate fits into 2i2c hub technology.\n(Definitions of MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY, etc are defined in RFC 2119)\n          User Code and Data May be Open Source We encourage adopting and producing open source code and data, but this is up to the user. e.g., licenses for user content/code   User Environment Should be Open Source Strong preference for open source tools only, although in some cases user needs may override this. e.g., Python, R, PyData stack.   2i2c Infrastructure Must be Open Source Strong commitment to using only open source software. e.g., JupyterHub, Kubernetes, Postgresql   Cloud Provider Infrastructure Must be Portable See this blog post for more information.     Below we describe our commitments in our own infrastructure stack in more detail.\nHow 2i2c infrastructure ensures this right 2i2c infrastructure and documentation for it MUST BE as transparent \u0026amp; accessible as possible, so customers can replicate our configuration without having to extract any ‘secret sauce’ from 2i2c. If they choose to, they can also inspect, audit \u0026amp; modify the infrastructure they are paying for and using.\nTo ensure the Right to Replicate to our customers, 2i2c makes the following commitments to infrastructure we build and operate:\n  We MUST use only open source software to run our infrastructure. By only using software that is available to everyone on the same terms, we can ensure that customers can replicate the infrastructure without having to negotiate licensing terms with proprietary software vendors. In addition, any changes we make to open source software will be made in public and/or contributed upstream, so customers continue to have access to them regardless of where their infrastructure is.\n  We MUST NOT directly depend on proprietary cloud vendor specific products or APIs. Instead, we use cloud-managed open source software, or hide the dependency behind a layer of abstraction. This ensures that customers can port their infrastructure to any cloud provider of their choice, or run it on their own hardware with purely open source software.\n  This set of commitments acts as a business continuity plan for our customers, ensuring 2i2c will follow best practices within the open source, open education and open research ecosystems.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144e3,"objectID":"f9d84027023bd7709772a71806b3aca9","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/right-to-replicate/","section":"","summary":"The Right to Replicate gives customers the right to replicate their infrastructure in its entirety elsewhere, with or without 2i2c.\nThis document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a customer’s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c.","tags":null,"title":"The Customer Right to Replicate","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0683f5804634b3020a9e3219fd1f3789","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/service/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/service/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"2i2c managed JupyterHubs","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"About 2i2c","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Open positions Below is a list of open positions at 2i2c. To be notified of any open positions, sign up for our mailing list.\n We are not currently hiring for any positions, but keep an eye here as we are a young organization and hope to expand soon!   Open Source Infrastructure Engineer: Pangeo Project  Dev-ops and infrastructure work Open source data workflows, pipelines, and environments Focus on Pangeo community and geospatial analytics  Salary: $110,000 - 130,000\nFully remote\n Details and Apply    -- Why 2i2c? 2i2c believes that open infrastructure is a crucial part of transforming research and education to be more powerful, more equitable, more inclusive, and more accessible. We are a small and growing team, and recognize that our early employees play a crucial role in setting the right culture and direction for the organization.\nHere are a few reasons that we think 2i2c is a fantastic team to work with.\nOur values and our mission drive our actions 🧭 2i2c believes in weaving our set of core values into everything that we do, and that this will guide 2i2c in being as impactful as possible. As a member of 2i2c’s team, you’ll have an opportunity to participate in a community that believes in these values, and tries to make the world a better place through living them every day.\nWe have great team culture 🙌 2i2c draws from experience in many large open source communities over the years. Because these communities operate fully remotely and strive to be as inclusive and participatory as possible, they must also strive to be more transparent and systematic in how they communicate, share information, and work. We are building a culture at 2i2c that follows these principles and builds upon them.\nWe have competitive pay and great benefits 📊 2i2c believes that it\u0026rsquo;s important for non-profit work to pay competitively with the tech industry. See more information on our salaries and compensation. We are also a remote-first organization with team practices that can be spread across the world.\nWe support research and education 🔬 All of the work we do at 2i2c feeds into our mission: to support research and education through interactive computing infrastructure. Being a part of the 2i2c team means that each day you will spend your time building, operating, and supporting the infrastructure that powers data-driven discovery and learning.\nOpen source communities are in our DNA 🤝 All of the technical development that we do is open source, usually in partnership with other open source communities rather than controlled entirely by 2i2c. This means that the work you do with 2i2c will benefit a much broader community, and you’ll be encouraged to connect with other open source communities as you do your work.\nSalary philosophy We pay competitive salaries for all of our employees at SF market rates. 2i2c chooses its salary levels based on job title and discrete levels that correspond to experience. These salaries are fixed and consistent across all employees of 2i2c \u0026ndash; we do not pay different amounts based on geographic location or cost-of-living, you will be paid the same regardless of where you live. 2i2c also offers a generous benefits package, or will provide extra compensation if you are not in a position to take advantage of US-based benefits packages.\nWhy approach salaries in this way? For a few reasons. First, we don’t believe that people should have to take a large pay-cut just to work at a non-profit organization, and we want to hire competitively for the tech industry. Second, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We don’t believe that your ability to help 2i2c accomplish its mission is impacted by your ability to negotiate a better salary. We also don’t think it is impacted by external factors like your geographical location or cost of living. Third, we believe in transparency and openness when it comes to our salaries, in order to balance the amount of information on both sides of the hiring equation. We think that these practices allow 2i2c to hire competitively, equitably, and successfully.\nBenefits For employees based in the US, 2i2c provides health benefits via its fiscal sponsor, Code for Science and Society (CSS). These are administered by TriNet\nFor employees who are not based in the US, we will compensate you for similar benefits that apply to your country of residence. This is country-specific and generally entails a discussion about compensation that is fair and equitable compared with others at the same job level.\nTime off The 2i2c team follows a \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t ask, do tell\u0026rdquo; policy when it comes to taking time off. We do not define strict restrictions about when people can take time off, and do not have a strict limit to the number of days that team members are away. Instead, we ask team members to communicate their intentions early with one another, and discuss with the team if anybody has concerns that a person\u0026rsquo;s absense will harm our ability to meet our goals.\nAs we are a distributed team across many countries, we do not differentiate national holidays from personal time off. Instead, we recommend that everybody takes at least 40 days of time off each year, without a strict cap on the number of days.\nMore information about our time off policies can be found in the Taking Time Off section of the team compass.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3f1a2c5f26bd71ce7094519646e3cd03","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/careers/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/careers/","section":"","summary":"Open positions Below is a list of open positions at 2i2c.
