The result of this work is a report that describes in detail the major strengths, weaknesses, challenges, and opportunities that 2i2c faces. It also recommends major actions to take as an organization.\n2i2c values organizational transparency and a willingness to be honest about where you’re struggling. Stress is a natural part of both individuals and organizations, and should be embraced with the goal of learning and improving. Moreover, as a young organization 2i2c has benefitted heavily from the documents and learning that other organizations have made publicly available. We wouldn’t be where we are without building on the backs of others who are willing to share what they’ve learned.\nSo, we are making this organizational audit and report public for anyone to see. We hope that it provides transparency into 2i2c’s current status, and that it serves as a useful resource for other non-profits that are growing and facing similar challenges.\nHere’s a link to the report on Zenodo .\nFor more background on this report, check out the short description below.\nIn April of this year we had our first in-person team meeting. We were excited and grateful to have the opportunity to speak to each other face-to-face. We also learned that many people on our team were stressed out! Our service had grown slow-but-steadily over the previous year, and we were feeling the tension that comes with growing your partnerships without significantly changing your team’s capacity or structure.\nSo, we decided to work with an organizational consulting group called makeadifference.digital to help us identify where we need to make improvements. They spent several weeks having one-on-one conversations with each member of the team, as well as doing a broader organizational analysis and comparison to other technical organizations at a similar stage of their lifecycle.\nThe result of this work was a report that outlines the major opportunities and strengths, as well as challenges and gaps in capacity, that our team currently faces. It makes a number of recommendations for how we should shift our practices, and importantly it also notes that the only way to gain that capacity is by hiring for new people and skills.\nHere’s a link to the report on Zenodo .\nThe immediate result of this work is that we currently have three jobs posted:\nA Product Lead role to help us build a “product function” within 2i2c’s team. A Delivery Manager / Chief of Staff role to oversee and manage 2i2c’s system of work. A cloud and operations engineering role to grow our cloud engineering team’s capacity in serving communities. Our next steps are to fill these positions, and to then begin the work of implementing many of the recommendations that are contained in the report. We’re confident that this is a natural part of being a small and growing organization, and we are grateful for the expertise of makeadifference.digital in guiding us through this work.\nNote: if you’d like to work with makeadifference.digital , you can reach out to them at hello@makeadifference.digital .\n💡 Follow our work!

In that time, we’ve been hard at work serving and growing our interactive computing service, as well as doing some introspection as a team and identifying major next steps moving forward. More on that in the following sections, but first a short service update.\nHow has our service evolved over the past few months? # New partnerships and service growth # Our service has grown several new partner communities over the last two quarters. A few notable communities are the NASA VEDA project , a team at the Smithsonian , a team at NCAR , and the U.S. Greenhouse Gases Center . We are running about 71 hubs across 24 clusters, with about 4000 weekly users ( more usage stats here ).\nWe also began operations on a major collaboration to serve communities in Latin America and Africa, called the Catalyst Project . This team met together for the first time in April, and we’ve been laying a foundation for service growth in the first several months. We are just onboarding our first communities and hope to grow that service in the coming year.\nFinally, we’ve been fortunate to receive some grants around creating content and designing workflows that utilize cloud infrastructure. For example, a NASA TOPS grant and an upcoming collaboration with Project Pythia around geospatial workflows.\nFinancial picture # At this point, we’re recovering roughly 40% of our operating costs through recurring fees of our managed hub service (making up the remainder in development contracts and grants), and we’ve currently got around 2 years of runway.\nHowever, both of these will be lowered soon because we are about to hire for several more positions. Improvements to our product model will allow us to estimate and recover our service costs more effectively, but we also intend to raise some funds next year to support our efforts in making our service more robust, sustainable, and valuable to communities.\nIt’s always difficult to strike a proper balance of team (and cost) growth against the financial buffer needed to assure your partners you’ll stick around, but we’re confident that the new hires described below will serve critical needs for our team and mission.\nFor more context on why and how we’re trying to make up that capacity, read on…\nHow service growth can lead to team stress # Over the past year we’ve had a slow-but-steady stream of new communities interested in working with 2i2c for managing cloud infrastructure for interactive computing. We’ve taken a “let’s make it work somehow” approach to all of our community partnerships thus far, with the idea that we must use these partnerships to learn what communities want and identify common patterns.\nThis is exciting, and we’re fortunate to see the interest and growth in our service. It suggests to us that something about our model is fundamentally right. Communities really love the Right to Replicate , and our participatory service model based around upstream contributions, transparency, and shared responsibility is attractive to many in research and education.\nHowever, each new community is also a new set of stresses on the technical and social infrastructure of our team. Without the capacity to manage the demands of the service, you run the risk of over-extending – and in a worst case scenario, burning out – your team.\nThis became clear in our first in-person team meeting last May. At that meeting, we realized that many on the team were spending too much of their time “reacting” to demands from the service. We also learned that the scope and complexity of our various workstreams had gotten to a size where our informal team structures of work prioritization were no longer adequate.\nGrowing the complexity of our team to match the complexity of our service # So, for the past several months we’ve been working on a plan to evolve 2i2c’s team structure in order to more effectively manage the complexity of our service, and balance long- and short-term thinking.\nThis began with an organizational audit carried out by makeadifference.digital , a consulting group that focuses on tech-for-good and non-profit products and services. They conducted interviews with everybody on the team, and concluded that we have a few key functions missing that were creating or compounding the stresses people felt.\nWe hope to make some of their key findings public soon (Update: this is now available at this blog post about the organizational report ), and in the meantime here is an overview of some highlights:\nWe need a dedicated product functionality # First, we realized that we have a number of new “signals” pushing our service in many different directions.

Some are internal - from different team member visions …","date":1698710400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1698710400,"objectID":"56a2060396fd8fc0261559080a80c3b2","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/2023-q3-update/","publishdate":"2023-10-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2023/2023-q3-update/","section":"blog","summary":"It’s been two quarters since our last major update - this isn’t quite as frequent as we’re hoping to post updates from our team, but we’re making adjustments to have more regular communication for reasons that will hopefully be a bit clearer below!","tags":[],"title":"Community update Q3 2023: Service growth and growing pains","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Chris Holdgraf"],"categories":null,"content":"We’re looking for a Product Lead who will be instrumental in shaping 2i2c’s product vision, strategy, and execution.

After several rounds of brainstorming, design reviews, and fine-tuning, we’ve landed on a visual identity that resonates with our organization.\nMeet Our New Logo and design system # Zack has created a set of Brand Guidelines that will guide our use of color and visual style in 2i2c’s materials.\nBelow is our new logo in square and wide form:\nOur logo comprises the International Interactive Computing Collaboration wordmark, characterized by our interactive i. We can fly it just about anywhere. A mark of constant progress \u0026amp; community-driven technology, it isn’t stuck to the borders that separate people. It brings us closer together.\nOur primary and secondary color palette is below:\nColor is the first visual thing we remember and a powerful asset in building brand recognition. Our color is blue. Our community blue says the sky is not the limit. It’s energetic and vibrant, just like the community we serve. And it’s our primary colour, supported by a lively secondary palette that’s as at home on digital platforms as it is on billboards.\nWe’ve chosen two fonts to use in the majory of the text that we write. Poppins for big, bold sentences, and Work Sans for more versatile and everyday use.\nFinally, you might notice these curving, criss-crossing strands in some of our materials. For example, in our new social media header:\nThey’re the strands that intersect and show how our work and values are interconnected to our community. We like them because they represent 2i2c’s core mission, which is to build connections between people, computation, and data in order to share open knowledge. We’ll try and think of creative ways to incorporate them into our visual style.\nWe believe our new visual identity is more than just a fresh coat of paint. It’s a reaffirmation of our commitment to our stakeholders and an exciting milestone in our ongoing journey. We can’t wait for you to see it in action, and are excited to hear what you think about it!\n❗ Note\nIf you’d like to get in touch with Zack Adell, please reach out on his LinkedIn profile , or his Instagram account .\n","date":1694044800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1694044800,"objectID":"7f71c8ae3d34bd6f8c813b9ef11e46d4","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/new-design/","publishdate":"2023-09-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2023/new-design/","section":"blog","summary":"We are thrilled to announce a revitalized visual brand for 2i2c.

We expanded our managed cloud service with new community partners, and made a number of improvements to our technical infrastructure and organizational processes for managing this service.\nRead on below to learn more about what we’ve been up to!\nNew community partnerships # We added several new community partnerships to our managed hub service. We’ve deployed new hub infrastructure for each of the following groups:\nOur University of Toronto Jupyter service now has a dedicated R hub. We ran an event hub for the Drakkar Ocean project We deployed a hub for the NASA Visuaslization Exploration and Data Analysis (VEDA) project . We deployed a hub for the QuantifiedCarbon organization. We ran an event hub for OceanHackWeek 2023 . We onboarded several new community colleges to our “JupyterHubs Education in Community Colleges” collaboration with CloudBank and UC Berkeley CDSS . Service improvements # Below are a few highlights for ways in which we improved our Managed Cloud Service for our partner communities.\nWe simplified our authentication workflow with CILogon # Authentication services allow us to identify a user when they log onto a hub, which determines their ability to access hub resources. Previously we had used a combination of Auth0 , CILogon , or GitHub for authentication.\nHowever, over the past year we’ve been happy with our use of CILogon so far, especially because of its non-profit status and alignment with many research and education institutions that we work with. This quarter, we decided to streamline our authentication process by dropping the use of Auth0 and grow our partnership with CILogon.\n💡 Learn more\nSee CILogon’s write up about it’s partnership with 2i2c See our blog post about our use of CILogon We exposed user activity dashboards in JupyterHub so communities know how many people are using the service # We tend to work with leaders of communities that utilize our service and infrastructure for many others in their network. For example, a teacher with a classroom of students, or a researcher with a global network of collaborators.\nIn these cases, it’s useful to track how many users are actively using a platform over various metrics of time. This can tell you whether your community finds a service useful, and whether this is growing or shrinking.\nWe use Grafana to automatically generate dashboards of activity for all of our community hubs and clusters. However, tracking daily, weekly, and monthly active users was not part of JupyterHub’s core functionality.\nSo, we decided to upstream this functionality into JupyterHub and expose it via the JupyterHub Grafana project . All 2i2c hubs now track daily, weekly, and monthly unique active users. And importantly, anybody else deploying the Zero to JupyterHub for Kubernetes can use this feature now too.\n💡 Learn more\nSee Yuvi’s blog post about this feature .\nWe made our support process more structured with a new support widget # We’ve added a support widget to our service documentation site . This will allow users to provide structured support requests directly to our team, allowing us to triage and respond more quickly.\nHere’s our support button and widget in action:\nOur fancy new support button! We upgraded Kubernetes across all of our AWS clusters # Kubernetes is at the core of our cloud infrastructure and scalability. We use either a shared or a dedicated Kubernetes cluster for each of our community partners, and it is the foundation upon which all of their Jupyter infrastructure rests.\nOne of the biggest challenges with managing an ongoing cloud service is keeping the underlying infrastructure upgraded. This brings in new stability and functionality, but also often involves manual steps and toil. This quarter, we upgraded each of our AWS JupyterHubs to Kubernetes 1.24 and will continue this effort with other providers in the coming quarters.\nWe streamlined our hub uptime checks to be more efficient # The best kinds of failures are ones that your operations team recognizes and solves before any users run into the problem themselves. We use the Google Cloud Platform HTTP uptime checker to run regular uptime checks for each of the community hubs that we use . This allows us to get quick alerts if any of our community hubs is down for some reason.\nWe made several optimizations to this process so that we can more efficiently monitor hub uptime and trigger alerts to our engineering team if action is needed.\nOrganizational updates # We made a number of broader improvements to our team processes and policies, and even got a shout-out from a few community partners!\nWe defined organizational …","date":168264e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":168264e4,"objectID":"837ca10f75690da78e1f6c20c1eef6d2","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/2023-q1-update/","publishdate":"2023-04-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2023/2023-q1-update/","section":"blog","summary":"It’s a month after the end of Q1 2023, and we’d like to share a belated update about what we were up to in the first quarter of this year (we have good excuses for being late, including new tiny humans, I promise).","tags":[],"title":"Community update Q1 2023: Growing our community partner network and our team","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Georgiana Dolocan"],"categories":["engineering","partnerships"],"content":" About CILogon # CILogon is an open source service provider that allows users to log in against over 4000 various identity providers, including campus identity providers. The available identity providers are members of InCommon , a federation of universities and other organizations that provide single sign-on access to various resources.\nCILogon and 2i2c # For the past year, 2i2c has been successfully using CILogon for more than fifteen of the hubs it manages.\nCurrently, most of the hubs that use it are hubs for communities in education that want to manage their hub access through their own institutional providers.\nWith using a tool like CILogon, we allow hub access to be managed both through the communities’ institutional providers, but also through social providers like GitHub and Google. Because both authentication mechanisms can coexist, there’s no need to provide specific credentials for 2i2c staff in order to have access to the hub. This reduces both the burden on institution’s IT departments, but also the complexity of a hub deployment.\nMoreover, as we migrate away from our current Auth0 setup, the number of hubs using CILogon will further increase in the following year.\nThe setup # The setup that 2i2c uses, is based on two important tools, the CILogon administrative client and the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator.\nThe CILogon administrative client # The 2i2c administrative client provided by CILogon allowed us to automatically manage the CILogon OAuth applications needed for authenticating into the hub.\nFor each hub that uses CILogon, we dynamically create an OAuth client application in CILogon and store the credentials safely, using the script at cilogon_app.py . The script can also used for updating the callback URLs of an existing OAuth application, deleting a CILogon OAuth application when a hub is removed or changes authentication methods, getting details about an existing OAuth application, getting all existing 2i2c CILogon OAuth applications.\nThe JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator # For CILogon’s integration with JupyterHub’s authentication workflow, we’re using the CILogonOAuthenticator , which is part of the JupyterHub OAuthenticator project . This is what allows JupyterHub to use common OAuth providers for authentication, and it’s also a base for writing other Authenticators with any OAuth 2.0 provider.\nAs part of this 2i2c integration with the JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator some important upstream fixes and enhancements to the oauthenticator were identified and performed. For example, the GHSA-r7v4-jwx9-wx43 vulnerability was reported and fixed, and a migration guide containing a description of the breaking changes that were made, together with a step by step guide for the users on how to update their usage of JupyterHub CILogonOAuthenticator was provided.\nRead more about how CILogon is setup for use at 2i2c from the docs .\nCelebration # Thanks to the 2i2c - CILogon partnership, during this past year we were able to integrate CILogon into 2i2c’s infrastructure and to observe its importance, usefulness and great support for 2i2c and the communities we server.\nWe are now happy to announce that the 2i2c - CILogon partnership has been expanded to another year!\nAcknowledgements: The upstream jupyterhub-oauthenticator project mentioned in this post as being used at 2i2c is a JupyterHub package, kindly developed and maintained by the JupyterHub community and the 2i2c integration described was developed by the 2i2c engineering team .

See our open source policy documentation for the product of this brainstorm.\nOver the past year the 2i2c team has focused its efforts on deploying, configuring, running, and managing cloud infrastructure that supports open source workflows in research and education. We’ve also done a lot of upstream contribution as a part of our work.\nHowever, we have shied away from taking direct funding for direct development work in open source projects. This is for two primary reasons:\nOur focus has been on managing cloud infrastructure, not developing it. We want to facilitate access to open workflows in interactive computing, which is a different skillset and kind of work than creating those tools. While 2i2c is aligned with the interests of open communities, we are still a distinct organization with our own mission and strategy. We want to be conscious that 2i2c team members have more than one hat, and that their 2i2c hat is necessarily not the same thing as their open source hat. As such, we don’t want to leverage our “other hats” to drive resources to 2i2c without being thoughtful about it. In the last year we’ve found that running infrastructure for research and education gives us great visibility into the kinds of things that these communities want to do, and ways to improve the infrastructure. It also means we can potentially be a conduit of resources from those communities into open source development workflows. For example, we recently partnered with GESIS to make improvements in Binder and JupyterHub .\nSo, this post is a brainstorm to identify some of the major considerations that we should take before agreeing to this kind of work. Its goals is to drive policy that streamlines our ability to seek and accept funding for open source work. It tries to answer this question:\nHow can a stakeholder accept funding on behalf of an open source community in a way that is inclusive, equitable, and effective.\nSome assumptions # First off I want to note that this only applies to open source projects that I’d call “Open communities”. For example, those that follow the principles of open scholarly infrastructure . The ideas here don’t apply to open source projects that are run by single organizations or people. You can assume I’m talking about projects that:\nHave inclusive multi-stakeholder governance and operations. Care about having a broad contributor and leadership base, and want to follow best-practices in inclusive and equitable operations. Need funding to drive major new efforts, or to sustain pre-existing maintenance and community management work. Why is this important? In short, because open projects should care about good governance, and about building sustainable and diverse multi-stakeholder communities around their operations and strategy. While it’s easy to ignore these considerations and just bring in money however you can (open source is perpetually under-funded, after all), it’s crucial that we think about how to do so in a way that aligns with the values of open communities, and that doesn’t simply propagate a “rich get richer” dynamic. Ultimately, the unique value of open communities is not in the technology they create, but in the way that they create it.\ntl;dr: An overview of major considerations # After working with several open source projects over the years, there are a few issues that I’ve seen come up again and again. Here’s a quick summary and I’ll note each in more detail below.\nGovernance: funding should follow major decisions, not make them. It should represent the interests of the project rather than those of a single stakeholder or payer. Transparency: stakeholders that accept funding should be transparent in their accounting (the sources of funding, deliverables attached with it, and operational costs), their plans (the work they plan to do and how they want to do it) and in their strategy (the reason they’re applying for funding in the first place, and how the work fits in with their other operations). Accountability: stakeholders that accept funding should be accountable to the open communities that they are supporting. There should be mechanisms for open communities to provide feedback about and influence their operations, ideally in a powerful position like a board seat. Equity: funding should be shared with others in the project, particularly those that need it or that couldn’t get funding on their own. Moreover, people should be paid for their time - if funding requires work from others, they should be compensated somehow. Inclusion: funding opportunities should be shared with others in a project, particularly those from historically disadvantaged communities. Stakeholders with funding “connections” should use them to boost others in the community as partners, not just as contractors Here is a more in-depth discussion of each below. …","date":1673136e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1673136e3,"objectID":"cb1504c087ebf49007ba3a9d79b5b280","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2023/open-source-funding-principles/","publishdate":"2023-01-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2023/open-source-funding-principles/","section":"blog","summary":"This is a brainstorm to consider the principles and guidelines that 2i2c should follow in defining its strategy towards open source communities.

This is a brief reflection on this experience, and an attempt to identify our opportunities for impact and growth in 2023.\nOur major goals in 2022 # We wrapped up 2021 with two major new changes. We had just finished moving fiscal sponsors and had just finished a prototype of our alpha service offerings .\nOur 2x2 matrix of service offerings and prices created at the end of 2021. See the documentation for more details. Our biggest challenge in 2022 was to identify the bottlenecks in this service model, and to begin building the infrastructure to operate and scale it. This included team infrastructure, technical infrastructure, and administrative infrastructure.\nLet’s see what we did to accomplish this goal.\nHighlights from 2022 # In 2022, we thoughtfully grew the number of communities we worked with, and used this to make iterative improvements in our model. As a result, we learned some important things and made significant improvements to our service model and infrastructure. Here are a few highlights.\nWe grew the number of our partner communities # As noted above, we needed to grow the number and diversity of communities we worked with to understand where our model needed to change. At the end of 2022, we now have 43 community partner hubs across 17 clusters (and at least one on AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud). This amounts to roughly ~2,500 active users each week. We also ran more dedicated infrastructure for more than 11 workshops and events.\nWe grew our revenue from community partnerships # One of our goals is to reach self-sustainability without requiring grant funding for most of the communities we serve. In 2022 we built administrative infrastructure to more efficiently recover monthly costs, and were able to bring in funding for our team from community partnerships. Here’s a plot of our monthly non-grant revenue over the last several months:\nOur monthly non-grant revenue over the last several months. June is much larger because we filled a backlog of invoices from previous months that weren’t billed yet. We got grant funding to serve communities in Latin America and Africa # We also learned that some partnerships may require subsidization from a third party, such as historically marginalized communities and those without dedicated resources. To explore sustainable ways to serve these communities, we applied for and received a new grant to serve communities in Latin America and Africa! Here’s the blog post announcing this grant and our open grant narrative from the proposal .\nWe improved our continuous integration and deployment system # Our ability to sustainably grow our service requires being able to technically serve many communities from a relatively small team. We centralized and standardized configuration and operations of many community hubs in one transparent space for all of our partner communities. This allowed us to more easily grow the number of communities we served from one repository. You can read a write-up about these improvements in this blog post .\nWe defined a Shared Responsibility Model # Our goal is to frame each community hub as a partnership with a clear breakdown of responsibility to give communities more agency over the infrastructure and service. The Shared Responsibility Model provides a framework for assigning responsibility for various tasks with our partner communities. See our Shared Responsibility Model docs here .\nWe defined a formal Incident Response process # Cloud infrastructure inevitably degrades over time, and running ongoing services is largely about quickly responding to issues and resolving them quickly. To do so, we need clear processes to follow in order to quickly identify and respond to major incidents in the infrastructure. Our Incident Response process defines formal team roles and alerting mechanisms that are served by PagerDuty , following best-practices in industry. This will make our service more reliable and make our processes more transparent for our partner communities. Here’s our current incident response process .\nWe expanded our service offerings to include community and workflow guidance # We recognized that many communities need more than just infrastructure running in the cloud - they will also benefit from usecase and community guidance.

It allows researchers to turn static code into interactive literate coding environments with a click of a button within seconds. The mybinder.org service is powered by BinderHub , an open-source tool developed by the Jupyter Project that many organizations have deployed for their own communities. It does this by _dynamically building _the software environment needed to reproduce a computation (using a tool called repo2docker ), and making this environment available to users.\nBinderHub was developed for use-cases that are temporary and fully open by design. BinderHub sessions are destroyed after a fixed amount of time and there is no persistent storage or authentication. However, many research institutions also need more “standard” service features like authentication and persistent storage.\nOver the past several years, the GESIS Notebooks team made the first steps towards bridging this gap through their Persistent BinderHub implementation. This was a modified and authenticated BinderHub that included persistent storage across sessions. The Persistent BinderHub service was very successful at GESIS and with its partner communities, and the team wishes to build this functionality into the JupyterHub community’s core technology so that these features can be enjoyed for more use-cases and by many communities.\nTo enable this vision, we have partnered with GESIS in cooperation with NFDI4DS (GAN: 460234259), CESSDA , and members of the JMTE project. This collaboration has three primary goals:\nGeneralize the Persistent BinderHub functionality/experience to run on cloud-agnostic infrastructure, so that other stakeholders in NFDI, CESSDA, and the broader scientific community may benefit from this functionality and experience. Upstream this functionality by making contributions into Jupyter community projects, so that it will be maintained and improved by a community moving forward, thus improving its reliability and sustainability. Improve the implementation and user experience around Persistent BinderHub, in order to make it more reliable, scalable, productive, and enjoyable to use. We began this collaboration several months ago, and have focused our efforts on exploring potential implementation pathways for this functionality. We believe that we now have a path forward for this functionality, and this blog post is a brief report of our efforts and future plans as we undertake this effort. See this GitHub Projects Board for issues that implement this effort .\nExploration 1: Adding persistent storage directly into BinderHub # Our initial intention was to incorporate persistent storage and authentication from the GESIS Persistent BinderHub into the BinderHub codebase . We began by holding a series of meetings to discuss technical requirements from our experience in the JupyterHub/BinderHub ecosystem, and also conducted an audit of the Persistent BinderHub codebase . The Persistent BinderHub implementation is a modified Helm Chart that configures a JupyterHub to expose its authentication and persistent storage functionality, overriding the BinderHub default behavior. We were concerned that building this functionality natively into BinderHub would be challenging given that the BinderHub codebase was designed for ephemeral user sessions.\nSo, we decided to take another approach:\nExploration 2: Add dynamic image building to JupyterHub # We realized that there is a way to make this functionality more broadly useful and more maintainable, while still achieving the end-user experience that the GESIS team needed. Instead of modifying BinderHub to incorporate JupyterHub’s storage and authentication features, we would give JupyterHub the ability do dynamically generate user environments using repo2docker .\nThis would give JupyterHub users more flexibility over the environments served by their hub, and expose Binder-style workflows to the “typical” JupyterHub workflow. BinderHub could then be simplified to re-use JupyterHub’s image building functionality as a part of its own service. We also identified a prototype of this functionality in the tljh-repo2docker project that QuantStack had built for the PlasmaBio project . This implementation was seen as successful, and something others in the community had wanted to generalize for some time.\nOur implementation plan # Two phases of implementation # With this alternative implementation route in place, we identified two major steps to accomplish this project:\nBuild a back-end for dynamic environment building. JupyterHub needs to understand how to call repo2docker’s image generation from a Docker-based environment. It needs to expose this ability via APIs that others can build interfaces on top of. **Build a front-end that is user-friendly and accessible. **Once the back-end is functional, we must build a front-end experience that feels familiar to BinderHub users and …","date":1669593600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1669593600,"objectID":"6a55a575b40906e55bc3821000992da8","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/gesis-2i2c-collaboration-update/","publishdate":"2022-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2022/gesis-2i2c-collaboration-update/","section":"blog","summary":"Introduction # Mybinder.org enables researchers across the world to replicate computational environments in the cloud.

It is a brainstorm from the Executive Director, shared as a blog post to invite feedback and provide transparency into our current thinking. Its goal is to explore the context of 2i2c’s stakeholders and their needs, and identify an opportunity and plan for having a positive impact with these communities. It is not a concrete proposal but a snapshot of thinking in time meant to trigger reflection. Over time we will incorporate some of these ideas into our Team Compass .\nWhen we founded 2i2c, we largely did so from the “bottom up” - we identified several patterns around hosted infrastructure that were useful at UC Berkeley , Pangeo , and similar communities, and we wished to make them more generalized, accessible, and scalable.\nWe defined our mission as the following:\nOur mission is to make research and education more impactful, accessible, and delightful by developing, operating, and supporting infrastructure for interactive computing.\nAnd a description about our immediate activities to make things a bit more concrete:\n2i2c designs, develops, and operates JupyterHubs in the cloud for communities of practice in research \u0026amp; education. It builds and supports open source infrastructure that serves these communities.\nAround a year ago we began our pilot JupyterHubs project to learn more about our biggest challenges and opportunities in making interactive computing more accessible and useful for research and education. While both of these statements are still accurate, over the past year we’ve also learned more about the value that 2i2c provides. This post is an exploration of how these statements and our strategy may evolve in the near future.\nWhat did we miss with our original strategy? # In short: it is too-focused on actions rather than impact.\nWhile running JupyterHubs is a key part of what 2i2c does, it is a means to an end rather than our end-goal. Infrastructure is only useful if it changes workflows in a way that aligns with the goals and values that we wish to achieve. We’ve historically defined these in a few scattered places. For example, here are the values listed on our website:\n2i2c values fairness and justice as requirements for successful communities. 2i2c values learning and discovery for all people. 2i2c values collaborating and connecting to foster environments for learning and discovery. However, it is difficult to tie our operations directly to values and goals without making them concrete, and without defining a plan that ties them to our work.\nThrough our JupyterHubs pilot, we’ve learned how our actions-focused approach was missing some important aspects of these broader goals. For example, we came to understand that a big part of 2i2c’s value isn’t just providing a JupyterHub, it is de-risking cloud native workflows for communities that are inherently skeptical of what cloud infrastructure offers. Doing this entails many things: teaching, making decisions on behalf of others, supporting and answering questions, building trust, and yes, managing infrastructure.\nRefining our strategy # With this in mind, we’d like to make our strategy more clearly-defined and tied to our operational choices. Here are a few ways we’d like to do this:\nDefine our organization’s values and vision for the impact we wish to have. Define the key stakeholder communities that we wish to serve, the context of tools and services that are relevant to these stakeholders, and the assumptions we’re making. Define the problems these stakeholders have, the ways in which their current workflow could be improved, and the opportunity to help them. Describe our strategy to positively impact these stakeholders with our work. Define a collection of goals and objectives to carry out this strategy in the near-term. The rest of this post will take a crack at answering a few of these questions. It is intentionally messy, and meant both as a public snapshot of my thinking at this moment, and fodder for discussion and more specific proposals in the future.\nContext: Our key stakeholders and the impact we wish to have # 2i2c’s key stakeholders are communities of practice that are dedicated to creating and sharing public knowledge. These are primarily made up of researchers and educators in the global community.\nFor these stakeholders, we wish to catalyze and support a transformation in their data workflows that allows them to be more collaborative, inclusive, efficient, and powerful in the impact they wish to have.\nAssumptions we make about our stakeholders # There are a few unique things about these communities that are important for us:\nResearchers and educators see their job as creating and sharing knowledge with a heterogeneous and global community. They can’t make many assumptions about the organizational context or resources of this community, or their work will become inaccessible to others.

However, it is also inaccessible to many for a variety of reasons:\nThere is a large, diverse, and messy ecosystem of open source tools to facilitate cloud infrastructure. Most communities don’t already have skills in utilizing cloud workflows. Running infrastructure in the cloud takes dedicated time and expertise that many communities lack. Many communities do not have organized communities of practice around cloud infrastructure. These issues are true for most scientific communities, but they are exacerbated in countries that are often marginalized in the global scientific community.\nOur proposed work # For this reason, our goal in this grant is to provide human and technical services to facilitate learning and knowledge transfer of cloud workflows for communities in Latin America and Africa.\nIt defines four major areas of collaboration:\nCloud infrastructure management - to facilitate access to cloud resources via managed cloud services that integrate open source tools. Application guidance and training - to provide community leaders with the skills to utilize this infrastructure for their needs. This includes language-localized content and training materials. Training for trainers - to provide community leaders with skills to share these workflows with others in their communities. Community leadership and management - to provide community leaders with skills to sustain and grow healthy communities of practice. If this proposal is funded, over the course of two years the team will provide a combination of the services described above for communities in Latin America and Africa, with the goal of understanding how such services can be most useful for these communities, how we can structure them to provide community representation in the direction of these services, and how we can sustain and scale this model of community-focused services for a global community.\nImportantly, we wish to do this work in a way that centers the communities we work with as co-leaders and collaborators in these services. We will explore ways to run these services and workshops so that they are transparent, inclusive, and give agency to the communities they support.

The event was hosted by the Cooperative Programs for the Advancement of Earth System Science ( CPAESS ) team at the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research ( UCAR ) with support from NASA.\nContext # The Symposium was framed by the interesting and interdisciplinary scientific career of the late Jack Eddy . Eddy’s legacy was highlighted and his influence has been extended by dynamic leadership from NASA Program Officer Madhulika Guhathakurta (Lika) . Lika helped launch and has sustained NASA’s Living with a Star (LWS) program over the past two decades. Prior to LWS, NASA had a variety of siloed efforts focused on near-Sun and near-Earth behavior. The LWS program led to an integration of these efforts under “system science” or “systems engineering” approaches and an expressed desired to connect LWS research activities with impacts on Earth (society, biology, culture, etc.). The program has expanded to include explorations of similar questions arising around other planets in our solar system and the recently discovered collection of exoplanets. Scientists from diverse disciplines (plasma physics, stellar evolution, atmospheric chemistry, space weather, planetary science,…) work together on “cross disciplinary” research that helps us understand our lives near our star.\nThe Symposium focused on three disciplinary areas (Exoplanets; Sun-Climate and Star-Climate interactions; Risk and resilience of space weather) unified under the cross-cutting thread of open science. Frequent references were made to the upcoming 2023 Year of Open Science and NASA’s Transform to Open Science (TOPS) mission . Symposium attendees listened to talks surveying the four areas in the morning and participated in hackathon-style breakout projects during the afternoons. Work on the projects launched at the Eddy Symposium continues . The space weather group is investigating ways to make the power grid more resilient. The Sun-climate group is exploring plans to establish an institute focused on Sun-climate interactions and improve connections between climate and heliophysics research communities. The exoplanets team is developing tools to programmatically compare Sun-Earth and star-exoplanet interactions.\n2i2c’s role # 2i2c, with input from Symposium CoChair’s Dan Marsh and Ryan McGranaghan , rapidly deployed a cloud-hosted JupyterHub for use during the event. The hub provided a shared space for participants to explore data, run analyses, and collaborate with one another using modern tools including Zarr, Xarray and Dask Gateway. Access to the interactive computing platform was granted to any member of the Symposium’s GitHub organization . The work to set up that hub, openly chronicled in this GitHub issue ( 2i2c-org/infrastructure#1329 ), included swapping out a Pangeo-style software environment for a heliophysics-specific resource developed by HelioCloud with special thanks to Brian Thomas !\n2i2c co-founder Fernando Pérez gave a talk on how he is “living la vida nube” . Fernando described the ways he, research collaborators, and students are using the Jupyter ecosystem. Diverse and curated tools in Jupyter hubs for the Jupyter Meets the Earth Project and Berkeley’s data science programs were highlighted. The talk showcased how these tools have been integrated to support individuals and communities of practice in data-driven research. In response to requests from the organizers and participants, Fernando gave a demonstration on how to use the hub 2i2c set up for the Symposium and an introduction to version control using git.\n2i2c co-founder Jim Colliander gave a talk titled Governing the Science Commons . Three key points from Jim’s talk were: the virtue that should guide the improvements to the scientific enterprise is intellectual generosity; implementation of intellectual generosity into science requires commons-based governance; the convergence of open source tools that support data-intensive collaborative research and learning (as showcased by Fernando) and agency interest ( NASA TOPS , UNESCO ) in open science is an inflection point for global change. The talk ended with a call to action for the diverse communities represented at the Symposium to improve the ways we do science.\nThings we learned # Our experience with the Symposium taught 2i2c a few things.\nWe learned that our engineering team can rapidly deploy interactive computing resources to support a research and education community. Along the way, we confirmed what we’ve been learning from Pangeo and the neuroscience communities: flexible methods to customize the software environment are necessary. We confirmed that our developing shared responsibility model , enabling domain-specific experts to provide curated toolchains for their communities while leveraging 2i2c’s infrastructure expertise, is the right approach.\nWe …","date":1657756800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657756800,"objectID":"5d36d9cc84a68609f47fb32b7b8d0f39","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/eddy-symposium-report/","publishdate":"2022-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2022/eddy-symposium-report/","section":"blog","summary":"Reflections on the Jack Eddy Symposium # 2i2c supported and participated in the 3rd Eddy Cross Disciplinary Symposium held recently in Vail Colorado.

This is a challenging problem, as it requires us to centralize information about a number of independent cloud services, and deploy them in an efficient and reliable manner. Our initial attempt at this had a number of inefficiencies, and we recently completed an overhaul of its configuration and deployment infrastructure.\nThis post is a short description of what we did and the benefit that it had. It covers the technical details and provides links to more information about our deployment setup. We hope that it helps other organizations make similar improvements to their own infrastructure.\nOur problem # 2i2c’s problem is similar to that of many large organizations that have independent sub-communities within them. We must centralize the operation and configuration of JupyterHubs in order to boost our efficiency in developing and operating them, but must also treat these hubs independently because their user communities are not necessarily related, and because we want communities to be able to replicate their infrastructure on their own .\nA year ago, we built the first version of our deployment infrastructure at github.com/2i2c-org/infrastructure . Over the last year of operation, we identified a number of major shortcomings:\nWithin a Kubernetes cluster, we deployed hubs sequentially, not in parallel. This grew out of a common practice of Canary deployments that allowed us to test changes on a staging hub before rolling them out to a production hub. We used a single configuration file for all hubs within a cluster, which led to confusion and difficulty in identifying a hub-specific configuration. Moreover, any change to a hub within a cluster caused a re-deploy of all hubs on that cluster. This is because we did not know whether a given change touched cluster-wide configuration or hub-specific configuration. Our goal # So, we spent several weeks discussing a plan to resolve these major problems - here were our goals:\nWe should be able to upgrade a specific hub alone, by inspecting which configuration files have been added or modified. Production hubs should be upgraded in parallel when they are effectively run independently. We should use staging hubs as “canary” deployments and not continue upgrading production hubs if the staging hub fails. An overview of our changes # To accomplish this, we needed to identify which hub required an upgrade based on file additions/modifications. This took a lot of discussion and iteration on design, and so we share it below in the hopes that it is helpful to others!\nImprovements to our code and structure # We made a few major changes to the infrastructure repository to facilitate the deployment logic described above. Here are the major changes we implemented:\nWe separated each hub’s configuration into its own file, or set of files. For example, here is 2i2c’s staging hub configuration . We created a separate cluster.yaml file that holds the canonical list of hubs deployed to that cluster and the configuration file(s) associated with each one. For example, here is 2i2c’s GKE cluster configuration , which contains a reference to the previously mentioned staging hub . We updated our deployer module to do the following things: Inspect the list of files modified in a Pull Request. From this list, calculate the name of a hub that required an upgrade, and the name of its respective cluster. Trigger a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys changes in parallel for each cluster/hub pair. In addition to these structural and code changes, we also developed new GitHub Actions workflows that control the entire process.\nA GitHub Actions workflow for upgrading our JupyterHubs # We defined a new GitHub Actions workflow that carries out the logic described above. These are all defined in this deploy-hubs.yaml configuration file . Here are the major jobs in this workflow, and what each does:\ngenerate-jobs: Generate a list of clusters/hubs that must be upgraded, given the files that are changed in a Pull Request.\nEvaluate an input list of added/modified files in a PR Decide if the added/modified files warrant an upgrade of a hub Generate a list of hubs and clusters that require upgrades, and some extra details: Does the support chart that is deployed to the cluster also need an upgrade? Does a staging hub on this cluster require an upgrade?

This is a quick post to celebrate the work we’ve done over the past three months, and to briefly share what we’re working on next.\nThese are the main highlights from this quarter - if you’d like to check out more of the work that we’ve done, see:\nAll the PRs we’ve merged in Q1 All closed issues in Q1 Infrastructure improvements # This quarter we did a deep dive into a number of core infrastructure improvements for our Managed JupyterHubs Service . Here are a few highlights:\nInfrastructure reliability and efficiency. We improved the resiliency, reliability, and efficiency of our deployment infrastructure . For example, we refactored our hub configuration so that each community is better-able to track it, we implemented validation steps to ensure that we don’t accidentally push incorrect config to the hubs, and we’ve significantly improved our CI/CD pipeline to push deployments out to our hubs more efficiently. Automatic deployments to commercial cloud. With the ICESat hackweek as a test-case for AWS, we’ve finished automating the deployment of clusters and hubs to each major commercial cloud. (there’s not a specific issue for this as it has been a multi-month effort over many PRs and issues!) CILogon authentication. CILogon is a non-profit organization that provides “single-sign on” authentication services for the same communities that 2i2c serves. We’ve partnered with them to prototype using CILogon for 2i2c’s hubs , which should make it much easier for communities to user their own institutional sign-ons. Communities we’ve served and lessons learned # As described in our Managed Hub Services strategy , our goals for this phase of our organization are to balance serving communities of practice and learning where we can improve our infrastructure and practices. With that in mind, here are a few highlights of communities we’ve served, and what we’ve learned from it:\nWe grew a hub for the University of Toronto to around 4000 monthly users. This has taught us a lot about where our support and operations can and cannot scale, and where we have gaps in our sustainability / pricing model. We deployed CILogon on a hub for a class at Australian National University . This gives us an opportunity to work out any UX issues and improvements to be made before a deeper CILogon integration. We deployed a dedicated database per user for a databases course at UT Austin . This is helping us learn more about how to pair slightly more customized per-user infrastructure with our standard hub setups, as well as how our Right to Replicate model could be followed for more complex setups like a database. We ran an event hub for the ICESat2 HackWeek at the University of Washington. This helped refine our infrastructure and expertise with AWS, as well as improved our event “ready mode” practices. We deployed a new hub for the LEAP project . This has given us an opportunity to prototype new processes for pass-through cloud costs to simplify our deployments. Organizational improvements\nBeyond our technical and community impact work, we’ve made a lot of significant organizational improvements as well.\nWe designed a new role in Product and Community Management . We’re excited for this new hire to spearhead efforts in guiding and developing relationships with the communities we serve, as well as guiding and collaborating with our engineering team in developing our services. We designed a new Project Manager role . Our engineering team had been operating as a largely autonomous and independent group, but we’ve realized that we would benefit from someone to help coordinate our actions and plans, especially as we balance more operations/support issues in addition to new development. This new role is an experiment at growing this capacity within our team, in the hopes that we can dedicate a team member to it in the future. What’s next # We are still working out our major priorities for the oncoming quarter, but have a few major projects in the works that we’re hopeful to make progress on quickly. Here are a few major examples:\nImprove our process and operations around supporting our users. We are discussing first- and second-line support processes to make our team more responsive and effective at resolving incidents. Improve our invoicing and contracting process. We are discussing how to reduce toil associated with invoicing in order to make this practice more reliable and efficient, along with our fiscal sponsor Code for Science and Society . Improving our reporting and monitoring infrastructure. We’d like to boost our ability to monitor activity on each of our hubs in order to identify when something abnormal is happening and get ahead of any potential problems (e.g., to avoid unintentionally large cloud bills).

We spent the hour discussing a number of questions that others had about the position. Below is a short overview of the questions and some responses, for those who were not able to attend. These responses are a bit rough, since they are mostly off-the-cuff based on the questions asked.\nUpdate 2022-03-24: We’ve added extra questions and answers below from our latest drop-in meeting.\nWhat does success look like in the short and long term? # This is an important question, with a few different kinds of answers.\nAs noted, this is the first hire of its kind inside of 2i2c, and it should bring a strategic and organization-building eye to the work that it does. To some extent, this role will be tasked with coming up with their own answers to these questions. This person should build a near- and long-term strategy for how Product and Community Engagement should evolve to be most-effective in accomplishing our mission. This will also mean defining goals and a strategy to meet these goals over time.\nWith that in mind, here are a few ideas we have in mind for goals that will drive this role:\n6 month goals for this role might be:\nBecome familiar with 2i2c’s organization, culture, mission, and team. Define an early strategy for how you’d like to incorporate Product and Community engagement into 2i2c’s operations, and set some Objectives or Key Results that we should use to measure success. This should include a plan for the two major objectives of this role: guiding and connecting with the communities we serve, and building design and planning processes that bring this perspective into our engineering and services. A few iterations on the execution of this strategy, with some demonstration of impact as well as some documented lessons learned. 2 year goals for this role might be:\nAn organizational strategy and structure has been created, defining the various roles that make up this division of 2i2c and their functions. Clearly defined team processes for major programs efforts that this role oversees, as well as interconnections with other major divisions of 2i2c (e.g. engineering or sales). For example, a framework for training community leaders and mechanisms or platforms for communication and engagement with our communities. A team exists that carries out these efforts, led by the Product and Community Lead. Clear demonstrated impact in the communities we serve, according to the OKRs and goals that have been set in this division. How does 2i2c provide mentorship/onboarding? # You can find our onboarding process in our Team Compass . This roughly comes down to choosing an “Onboarding Champion” for the new team member, to help walk them through our team processes and get them access to the right information and accounts. However, 2i2c is quite young, so has only had a few iterations in onboarding new team members. We look forward to improving this process further via this new hire.\nWhat are the largest challenges that someone might face in their first year in this position? # The largest challenge is largely related to ambiguity and fluidity of this role, due to the fact that 2i2c is small and relatively young. As noted above, this position will have a great deal of autonomy, and will be expected to show leadership in defining the nature of this work within 2i2c. This can either be exciting or scary depending on your comfort level with ambiguity! We recognize that it is an anti-pattern to have roles without clearly-defined measures of success, so we’re committed to defining this quickly in partnership with the new hire. However, we don’t want to be overly-prescriptive in this role, because we want it to have space to lead these efforts within 2i2c.\nHow do you hope to protect the “business” aspects of 2i2c, if all the tech is open source? # 2i2c is to some extent committing to a limiting business model: by respecting the Right to Replicate , we encourage other organizations to perform the exact same kinds of services that 2i2c offers. However, we believe this is in-line with 2i2c’s mission, and would consider this to be a measure of impact rather than a sustainability problem. In short: our goal is not to become a tech giant or start-up unicorn, we want to sustain a team with competitive pay, and we want to scale as there is more opportunity to serve new communities. We believe that the complexity of integrating tools and managing cloud services means that there will always be enough of an opportunity to bring in ample funding for this model. We also hope that our mission-driven nature and focus on research and education will bring in new kinds of funding opportunities that can sustain 2i2c and its mission.\nHow would applying the “1000 true fans” approach work in terms of advocacy? # The 1000 true fans approach suggests that it is enough to leverage the support of “1000 true fans” to sustain a product or …","date":1647907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1647907200,"objectID":"a610fec4ca5e5927b338d93661fa3039","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/","publishdate":"2022-03-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2022/product-community-lead-drop-in-notes/","section":"blog","summary":"Yesterday we had a quick “drop-in” session to take questions about 2i2c’s job posting for a Product and Community Lead .

It is similar to a mixture of product management and community and developer advocacy in a tech firm, but adjusted for research, education, and open source contexts. It is also similar to a Research Applications Manager , but with a focus on using and developing infrastructure.\nThe skills required are a combination of communication, teaching, learning, service design and delivery, and technical acumen. The person that fills this role should feel comfortable learning and sharing ideas, empowering and guiding others, and communicating clearly and collaboratively with a variety of stakeholders including end-users and engineers.\nThis is a leadership role for a strategy-minded practitioner. 2i2c is a young organization, and this role will have a large degree of autonomy and flexibility. We have defined the starting point, but we seek someone who can bring a strategic eye to this position. Over time we hope that the role will grow to define and lead this style of work within 2i2c more broadly.\nWhat you’ll do # This role is a combination of connecting, guiding, leading, learning, communicating, and empowering stakeholders in the communities we serve, as well as the 2i2c engineering team. Here are some key focus areas with core responsibilities under each:\nGuiding and learning from communities we serve # Our users are often not “power-users” with Jupyter, open source workflows, or cloud-native workflows. This role should work with users of these communities to guide them in using our infrastructure for maximal impact. Below are a few example responsibilities:\nUnderstand the goals and needs of the communities we serve, as well as the major pain points and problems that they have. This understanding may not be directly communicated and will be gained through active observation. For example:\nCreate and engage in spaces for sharing information with users. For example, online forums and live community discussions. Engage in community-specific spaces. This role may monitor and participate in community spaces in either research or education (e.g., the Pangeo forum , the Jupyter forum , or forums for education communities) to track relevant conversation and provide guidance as-needed. Guide communities and their leaders for the use-cases that 2i2c wishes to enable, and how our infrastructure (Jupyter, JupyterHub, open source tools, etc) can be used to have the most impact. For example:\nDevelop user-facing materials (documentation, workshops, talks, etc) that demonstrate the basic use-cases that we support, and the best ways that the infrastructure can be used to accomplish community goals. For example “Teaching with Jupyter” or “An Introduction to Scalable Computing with Dask.” Provide one-on-one or group guidance to our user communities (particularly leaders in those communities) with the goal of transferring knowledge that they can then share within their peers. Foster deeper external relationships and engagements with key communities of practice and partners that are important for 2i2c’s strategy, such as the Pangeo Project (which is a key stakeholder for this role).\nEngage with potential communities and stakeholders, with a focus on demonstrating the use-cases we hope to support and generating new service contracts with these communities. Communicate externally to demonstrate impact. For example, by participating in meetings, conferences, and other events where we have an opportunity to highlight the work that 2i2c does. Interact extensively with open source communities that underlie our infrastructure, potentially serving in leadership roles and doing significant work to support these communities.

We are seeking a product and community lead with the following two goals:\nEmpower the communities we serve to have impact with our infrastructure. Guide our development and service design to reflect the needs of our users. This role will work alongside our engineering team as a partner, and will serve as a high-bandwidth interface to the communities that we work with.\nYou can find a link to the full job posting below, the rest of this post is a short rationale for this role, and how we hope it will fit within 2i2c’s team and strategy.\nLearn more and apply Why a new role? # When 2i2c began a year ago, we hired a team of engineers that had experience in cloud infrastructure, Jupyter, and open source ecosystems. In that time, we’ve built out the infrastructure foundation for scalable interactive computing environments that are customizable for the community, and respects their Right to Replicate .\nHowever, solely providing infrastructure is not enough. Working with the modern open source stack, using the cloud to its advantage, and bringing these tools into specific domains requires a lot of extra experience and expertise. We believe that 2i2c is in a good position to provide guidance and support to leaders in the communities that we serve, allowing them to get up-to-speed with the infrastructure more effectively so that they can have an impact.\nMoreover, we’ve also learned that it’s crucial to develop infrastructure in collaboration with the communities that we’re serving. A team of engineers tends to focus on code and infrastructure, and having a role that focuses on connecting with communities will give them an excellent perspective on what those communities need.\nWe hope that this role will combine these two aspects to create a culture of learning, sharing, and guiding between 2i2c’s team and the communities that we work with.\nWhat are similar roles? # We tried to find similar roles in the private and non-profit sector, but couldn’t find anything that was a perfect fit. However, there were a few close matches.\nThis role is kind-of like a product manager - their job is to understand the communities that we work with, and to use this to help us make decisions about what to build, how to present it, and how to engage with stakeholders. They will need to help us prioritize the work that is most impactful for our mission, and help us navigate trade-offs in the evolution of our services.\nThis role is also kind-of like a customer success manager or a developer advocate - they will guide and teach those in the communities we serve - particularly community leaders that go on to teach others - how to use our infrastructure most-effectively.\nIn fact, the closest role we could find is a relatively new one: the Research Applications Manager . This is a role that has been pioneered by the Turing Institute, and is similarly described as a connector that brings together many perspectives and encourages a participatory, team-based approach to research.\nHowever, the reality is that the person in this role will ultimately get to shape the nature of their work within 2i2c. As a young organization, there is a lot of flexibility for creativity and experimentation in bringing new skillsets into our organization. We hope that the person who fills this role will be excited about growing a culture of team-based approaches to our engineering and collaborations, and to share this culture with the communities that we serve.\nWhat’s next? # Effective today we are opening up applications for this position, and will begin reviewing them in 2 weeks on a rolling basis until the position is filled.

In this year we have grown, experimented, and accomplished a lot - we have also faced challenges and learned as a team. Our primary goal in 2021 was to build a strong foundation for 2i2c.\nTo reflect on our work thus far, we’re writing three blog posts that describe progress in major areas of work towards this foundation for 2i2c. These three areas are:\nCreating services for use-cases - these are our first managed infrastructure offerings for communities in research and education. Developing cloud infrastructure and tools - this is the technical backbone that makes these services possible, built entirely on open source tools. Building an organizational foundation - this is the creation of our team structures, processes, and culture that help us carry out our mission. This first post will focus on services that we’ve created in our first year.\nUltimately, 2i2c’s mission is to facilitate use-cases in research and education via open source development and services. Throughout 2021 we ran several pilots to learn more about the needs of communities in research and education, and how we could build sustainable services that meet these needs. Here are some highlights for each major use-case we have targeted thus far:\nEducational community hubs # A primary use-case that 2i2c seeks to enable is collaborative, distributed educational spaces for learning with data. In 2021 we ran several pilots with educational communities:\nA university-wide hub for the University of Toronto. This hub is used in a variety of classes throughout the university, and is made freely available to anyone with a UofT account. We hope to repeat this model for other university-wide communities, and have learned a lot about the challenges of working with particularly large educational communities.\nSeveral hubs for community colleges across California. In partnership with UC Berkeley and CloudBank, we’ve run several hubs for nearly a dozen small community colleges teaching the Data 8 curriculum for their students. These hubs are lightweight and offer standardized environments for their students to use, in order to lower the cost of deploying and maintaining the hubs over time.\nWhat we learned # The organizational context around educational use-cases is different from research communities. Compared with research groups, educucational groups have more variance in their size (classes as small as 10 people and as large as 500) and think about cost by the student, not as a lump sum. This means that our initial hub-based pricing model may not map cleanly onto educational contexts, and we need to improve the match of scalability and price to these communities.\nMoreover, we’ve learned that for these communities, navigating all of the open source tools that are available for pedagogy is confusing! Everybody wants auto-grading but it’s unclear what is the “right tool for the job”. Tools like nbgitpuller have heavy use at “power universities” like UC Berkeley, but many others don’t know that it exists! We will need to invest more time into building guides and documentation that help others leverage these tools.\nResearch in the cloud # In addition to educational use-cases, we ran several pilots for research communities in order to leverage cloud infrastructure for scaling their work or collaborating more effectively.\nWe migrated Pangeo’s cloud infrastructure to be run via 2i2c. The Pangeo Community had been operating and developing their own JupyterHub for several years, but were looking for another organization to provide more reliable/sustained operations and support for their Pangeo Cloud Service. This year we migrated the service to run off of 2i2c’s deployment infrastructure .\nA scalable cloud hub for a SWOT satellite team. The MEOM research group at Grenoble is doing work with the NASA SWOT satellite project . However, the datasets generated from this project are huge, and only storable via the cloud. We’ve set up a JupyterHub to provide cloud-based access to this data, running a Pangeo-like environment.\nWhat we learned # Research communities tend to have more usecase-specific needs than educational ones. While introductory courses in data science tend to be similar across institutions, research needs are much more unique to the problem and team at hand. Moreover, they tend to want infrastructure that runs via institutional cloud accounts. This is possible due to the flexible nature of Jupyter and JupyterHub, but brings extra challenges in bureacracy and access permissions, given that 2i2c engineers usually are not members of these organizations already.\nAdditionally, many research use-cases are based around the location of the data. This is because data is the hardest thing to move from cloud to cloud. For this reason, it’s important to bring interactive sessions to the data. Jupyter’s ecosystem makes this possible, but we’d like to do more to make this easier.

We have recently finished re-creating the Pangeo community JupyterHub hosted on GCP in the 2i2c-org/infrastructure repository. This is a huge milestone in our partnership with Pangeo to provide expertise and operations of cloud-based, vendor-agnostic Jupyter infrastructure and workflows.\nFor users of Pangeo Cloud, the switch should have been a smooth one! The new hub should behave nearly identically to the old one, and will be managed by 2i2c engineers moving forward, in partnership with the Pangeo community. It will be available at the same URL ( https://us-central1-b.gcp.pangeo.io ) and there’s no need to worry about your home directories, they were synced to the new hub only a few days before the migration took place. Development and operations on this hub will all be done in the open and we invite participation and feedback from others in our infrastructure work. Please see this Discourse thread as an initial place to provide feedback.\nOn 22nd November 2021, the old Pangeo GCP JupyterHub will be shut down, and the project will move forward on the new 2i2c Pangeo Hub. Moving forward, we plan to collaborate together in order to find new pathways for development in the Jupyter ecosystem - we will share more ideas of things we will work on soon!\nHistory of Pangeo Cloud Hubs # Pangeo has pioneered a new model in using open source and cloud-agnostic infrastructure to support scientific research in the cloud.\nThe first Pangeo cloud JupyterHub (pangeo.pydata.org; now defuct) was deployed for the 2017 American Meteoroligical Society Meeting ; since then, the Pangeo community has iterated through several different versions of prototype cloud-based hubs. This allowed for many new workflows that enabled a more open and collaborative pathway to doing world class research, and included access to datasets and computational resources that were previously unattainable. Pangeo achieved this by working in partnership with open source communities and building technology that leveraged modular open source components for their platform.\nIn the last several years, Pangeo have built a thriving community of practice around this infrastructure. However as the community has grown, so has the need for more reliable and dedicated operational and developmental support since parts of the Pangeo stack require dedicated expertise and attention to managed. Modern scalable cloud infrastructure is one example of this. Maintaining a complex JupyterHub with many users is a difficult task, and has required significant resources from the Pangeo Project up to this point.\nThe Pangeo-2i2c Partnership # 2i2c is a non-profit team that develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing workflows. We have extensive experience in Jupyter workflows in the cloud and a long history of contributions to projects in this ecosystem. We have built a cloud deployment management system that allows us to centralise and configure the deployment of many independent JupyterHubs, empowering communities to leverage the same infrastructure (and team!) for JupyterHubs running in the cloud.\nSimilarly to Pangeo, all of 2i2c’s core infrastructure is cloud- and vendor-agnostic, and follows a model of building open source tools and giving back to those communities. Our partnership with Pangeo began through 2i2c’s core competency in these areas and the similarity between the two project’s technical stacks.\nWe’ve begun a partnership whereby 2i2c will manage Pangeo’s cloud infrastructure and lead efforts to develop new features, in partnership with open source communities. We sketched out a few ideas to focus on in this kick-off thread on Discourse . This approach allows each community to focus on it’s core strengths: Pangeo will continue to grow an open community and scientific software ecosystem around geospatial analytics, and 2i2c will oversee the development and operations of the core cloud infrastructure stack that powers Pangeo’s workflows. In some areas we are still experimenting with different collaboration models to ensure that the needs of the Pangeo community are met in a way that is also sustainable for 2i2c. Over the coming weeks, you may see some conversations (and threads for feedback!) about different support and operations models that work best for the community. We are excited to use this as an opportunity to learn more about how to serve more complex and diverse communities like Pangeo.\nWe are extremely grateful to the Pangeo project for giving us the opportunity to serve their community, and we look forward to a long partnership ahead! 🚀\n","date":1637020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637020800,"objectID":"24f81ee8ba42c2db1774c4d417072c6f","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/","publishdate":"2021-11-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021/pangeo-goes-live/","section":"blog","summary":"2i2c are pleased to announce that the first Pangeo JupyterHub is now live on 2i2c-operated infrastructure! :tada: ","tags":["2i2c","pangeo"],"title":"Pangeo Cloud goes live on 2i2c!","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Chris Holdgraf"],"categories":["updates"],"content":" This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we’ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we’re up to next.

Since then, we have been hard at work to make 2i2c’s organizational and infrastructure more robust and sustainable.\nThere are several major strategic areas where 2i2c aims to have impact, and we’ve split this community update along each of these major areas below. We’ll cover major highlights, challenges we’ve faced, and where we’re going next.\nHighlights # Managed JupyterHub Service # Our Managed JupyterHub Service will be a sustainable, scalable, and participatory service to provide cloud-based DevOps around JupyterHub for communities of practice in research and education. For the past several months, we have been running individual JupyterHubs for many organizations as a pilot, in order to learn more about the challenges we’ll face, and give ourselves an opportunity to build centralized infrastructure around the service.\nWe focused on a few major areas for work, outlined below:\nAutomation across cloud providers. We wish to serve communities that run on any of the major commercial cloud providers. We can standardize some of our infrastructure through abstractions like Kubernetes, but must still create cloud-specific deployment infrastructure as well (that Kubernetes cluster has to come from somewhere first!). In the last four months we’ve worked on automating Kubernetes and JupyterHub deployments on AWS as well as Azure to complement our Google Cloud deployments. We would soon like to run more hubs on this infrastructure to test how well it scales. Monitoring and reporting infrastructure. We have worked on the JupyterHub grafana-dashboards project to improve dashboarding around JupyterHub deployments in general, and will soon automatically deploy Grafana dashboards for our hubs so that communities have insight into what is going on in their hubs. User environment management. We want communities to have control over the environments that are available on their hubs. We also want to encourage that our communities follow community standards for reproducible environments that can be re-used elsewhere. For this reason, we’ve improved the repo2docker GitHub action to work with more image registries, and created a 2i2c user image template repository for users to re-use for their hubs. See the User Environment docs for more information. Support and collaboration roles. In addition to technology changes, we have developed an alpha-level support and collaboration model for the communities we serve. Most relevant for our communities is the community representative role, who acts as the main point of contact with 2i2c engineers, and leads administrators on the hub to guide its customization for the community it serves. See the user roles documentation for more information. We have also begun prototyping a FreshDesk support model and team processes around monitoring our support channels and responding to requests and incidents. Pangeo # We are working with the Pangeo Community to migrate the Pangeo JupyterHub deployments to utilize 2i2c’s centralized infrastructure, with the goal of 2i2c taking over the development and operation of Pangeo hubs moving forward. We have spent the last few months re-creating the Pangeo hub environment from scratch on a new cloud project controlled by Columbia University, and are nearly ready to begin migration from the “old” Pangeo hub to the new one. After this, we will focus our attention on re-creating the Pangeo BinderHub and AWS hub. Follow along with this work in this GitHub Project .\nExecutable Books / Jupyter Book # We are nearing the final year of a grant from the Sloan Foundation to support development on the Executable Books Project . As such, we have begun shifting our attention to create a strategy for sustaining the project’s community beyond this grant . In the coming months we plan on prioritizing improving our documentation (both for users and developers), as well as improving the general maintainability and quality of our codebases.\nJupyterHub community support # We recently collaborated with the JupyterHub community to apply for two CZI EOSS awards . Last month, we were notified that our application to support a Community Strategic Lead was funded! This role will fund Sarah Gibson’s time to focus some of her thinking on building community structures and dynamics that are inclusive and sustainable. We’ll update with more information as this project starts moving. …","date":1633824e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1633824e3,"objectID":"eb8170fad0ccceb7840702fd5c2ef642","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/q3-update/","publishdate":"2021-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021/q3-update/","section":"blog","summary":"This is a (roughly) quarterly update for the 2i2c community, with the goal of providing transparency about what we’ve been up to, sharing what we are working on and where we have struggled, and discussing what we’re up to next.","tags":[],"title":"Community update Q3 2021: A new fiscal sponsor, improving our infrastructure, nearing an alpha launch.","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Chris Holdgraf","Danielle Robinson"],"categories":["updates"],"content":"This post was originally written for the CS\u0026amp;S blog .\nCode for Science \u0026amp; Society is thrilled to welcome the International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project! After spending a year incubating in the International Computer Science Institute , where 2i2c received critical startup support , 2i2c now joins our fiscally sponsored project program to launch their next phase. 2i2c develops and operates cloud infrastructure for interactive computing, with a focus on the Jupyter ecosystem and cloud-native workflows in research and education. They will build a cloud services model that respects a community’s Right to Replicate their infrastructure by providing transparent and customizable JupyterHub deployments on cloud infrastructure that utilize community-driven open source tools. They aim to use the resources generated from this service in order to support the communities that underlie this infrastructure. Read on for more about 2i2c’s mission and how CS\u0026amp;S will support their team and vision.\n2i2c’s organizational mission is to develop and operate sustainable cloud services that provide interactive computing infrastructure with JupyterHub and an ecosystem of tools that support research and education. This model has been pioneered in the organizations that 2i2c’s co-founders have co-led for many years, including the Pangeo Project , the Syzygy Project , the Binder Project , and the UC Berkeley DataHub . These projects follow an “integrate, customize, and upstream” model. They integrate pre-existing open source tools, make necessary customizations to support their specific use-case, and make upstream contributions to extend the infrastructure beyond its current capabilities. This creates a virtuous cycle where tangible needs are met in research and education, while improvements are made to open source projects that benefit the broader community. 2i2c hopes to scale this model, and provide these JupyterHub-based cloud services available to the broader research and education community.\nCS\u0026amp;S is particularly interested in pursuing the opportunity to work closely with 2i2c as their team explores how to build sustainable, ethical services that support open scholarship as well as open source communities. The model that 2i2c will develop is different in many ways from traditional grant-based development, or service-based business, because it depends on running community-led infrastructure that 2i2c contributes to, but does not control or own. Both CS\u0026amp;S and 2i2c believe that this model is an opportunity to build more distributed, community-led infrastructure and services, as well aligning a sustainability model with both open source communities and the scholarly community. We hope that this work will also provide experience that helps improve CS\u0026amp;S’s other initiatives in this space, including CS\u0026amp;S’s other fiscally sponsored projects and participants in the Digital Infrastructure Incubator program .\nAchieving this mission will involve innovation at an infrastructure level, a business model level, and an open source community strategy level, and will be carried out over the coming years. 2i2c’s next steps are to run pilot JupyterHub infrastructure for select communities of practice in research and education, in order to better understand their needs and how these needs fit in with 2i2c’s developing sustainability model. They will also build infrastructure to deploy and customize a federation of JupyterHubs that are community-specific, and that run entirely on open source infrastructure.\nIf you believe that your community would benefit from a hub like this, please reach out to the 2i2c team , or join their mailing list . Stay tuned as 2i2c builds its sustainable, scalable, and community-driven platform for interactive computing in the cloud.\n","date":163296e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":163296e4,"objectID":"2a879062b3520ec9de025b6fcd6be1b1","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/css-announce/","publishdate":"2021-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021/css-announce/","section":"blog","summary":"This post was originally written for the CS\u0026S blog .\nCode for Science \u0026 Society is thrilled to welcome the International Interactive Computing Collaboration (2i2c, for short) as a fiscally sponsored project!","tags":["2i2c"],"title":"2i2c launches next phase in partnership with CS\u0026S","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Damián Avila"],"categories":["development"],"content":"","date":1630713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1630713600,"objectID":"7129084e54d4bda7b3ec37c3b41dc2b3","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-2/","publishdate":"2021-09-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-2/","section":"blog","summary":"","tags":["jupyter","executablebooks"],"title":"A deep dive into MyST, Part 2: The MyST-Parser, Docutils and Sphinx","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Damián Avila"],"categories":["development"],"content":"","date":1629676800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1629676800,"objectID":"d6c2657172e1b9cf296716eda7200d3d","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-1/","publishdate":"2021-08-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/blog/2021/myst-nikola-part-1/","section":"blog","summary":"","tags":["jupyter","executablebooks"],"title":"A deep dive into MyST, Part 1: The MyST-Parser Python API usage in Nikola","type":"blog"},{"authors":["Chris Holdgraf"],"categories":["organization"],"content":"It has been about six months since 2i2c first began operations (after receiving funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative ). In that time we’ve made progress along several directions, and wish to use this blog post to provide updates about the ways in which 2i2c has evolved over the first months of its existence.\nBelow are a few major updates from the 2i2c community - as always, if you want to learn more about 2i2c, keep an eye on our blog or subscribe to the 2i2c mailing list .\nEarly pilot JupyterHub infrastructure # First off - we have been making progress building out our JupyterHub deployment infrastructure for 2i2c. One of our major organizational goals is to build a sustainable service managing open source cloud infrastructure for interactive computing. This service will provide hosted, customized JupyterHubs for communities of practice in research and education. They’ll be built entirely with open source tools that are community-driven, and that respect the community’s Right to Replicate .\nIn order to accomplish this, 2i2c is running several pilots with partners and interested organizations, supported by our funding from CZI , as well as from the JROST rapid response fund . These pilots are meant to be learning opportunities to understand what kind of infrastructure and service it needs to build moving forward.\nThe documentation for our pilot hubs infrastructure contains information about our deployments and infrastructure. It is served from this 2i2c-org/infrastructure repository , a centralized location for configuring and deploying a federated network of JupyterHubs. Each JupyterHub is independent of one another, and could be spun out from the centralized repository with minimal extra work, giving hub users the ability to replicate their infrastructure, with or without 2i2c . We will continue refining the code in this repository as we learn more from our hub infrastructure pilots.\nJupyterHub for geospatial analytics - A collaboration with Pangeo # As originally announced on the Pangeo blog , 2i2c is forging a collaboration with the Pangeo project around operating and developing cloud infrastructure for large-scale geospatial analytics! This collaboration is funded through a grant from the Moore Foundation (via Pangeo investigator Ryan Abernathey).\nOver the coming months, 2i2c plans to assume operation of infrastructure underlying the Pangeo project, allowing the Pangeo team to focus their efforts on their core scientific and development missions. Because Pangeo’s infrastructure is already running on a fully open source stack with JupyterHub, our first step will simply be to shift control over this infrastructure to 2i2c engineers. We don’t anticipate needing to make major changes to their infrastructure and deployments (part of the benefits of using open, modular tools).\nOnce this is complete, we’ll next shift our attention to some new areas of development that support use-cases in the Pangeo community (and in the scientific community more broadly). There’s a lot of progress that we imagine making - such as supporting publishing pipelines via the Pangeo Gallery or improving tools for scalable computing with Dask Gateway . We’ll provide updates as we formally begin this collaboration and hash out a plan for our next steps.\nJupyterHub for education - A collaboration with CloudBank and UC Berkeley # In addition, we’ve begun a partnership with the UC Berkeley Data Science in Undergraduate Studies program , as well as CloudBank . This collaboration aims to provide hosted JupyterHub infrastructure for community colleges across the state of California. It is an attempt at providing vendor-agnostic and open-source infrastructure to several institutions who would otherwise not be able to deploy this infrastructure on their own.\n2i2c will provide the deployment and configuration architecture for this collaboration, working with Sean Morris in operating this educational infrastructure. All of the cloud infrastructure for this pilot will be funded via CloudBank. We will begin by offering environments that are modeled after the Data 8 course at UC Berkeley . This is part of an effort to build a community of practice around Data Science education using open source tools.\nNew team members # We’ve also welcomed two new members to the 2i2c core team! 🎉\nThese individuals will both work towards 2i2c’s major projects , and collaborate together on running our 2i2c Pilot Hub infrastructure. Here’s a bit about each new team member.\nDamián Avila . Damián has been a Jupyter core team member for many years now, and has done work across many different parts of the PyData stack (in particular, Jupyter , Bokeh , RISE , and Nikola ).

Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative . You can find CZI’s announcement here .\nThis funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨\nThe rest of this post is a short run-down of what we’ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.\nThe big picture # In recent years, several projects including Binder , Pangeo , Syzygy , and the Berkeley DataHubs have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.\nIn order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.\nBelow are two keys goals for this grant:\nGoal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education # The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter’s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support Chris Holdgraf to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.\nWe are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.\nGoal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education # 2i2c will offer hosted interactive computing infrastructure utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c’s first hire - Georgiana Dolocan as an Open Source Infrastructure Engineer. Georgiana has been the JupyterHub Contributor in Residence for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!\nGeorgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.\nThis is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with an outreachy internship followed by a term as Contributor in Residence . Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and NumFOCUS for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the CZI EOSS grant series for funding the original Contributor in Residence.\nWhat’s next # With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its JupyterHub pilot deployments to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please reach out to 2i2c and let us know!\nMany thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally.

It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.\nThis is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you’d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out this talk about 2i2c at JupyterCon 2020:\nWhy create 2i2c? # The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including bringing data science education to thousands of students , connecting geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud , and providing federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada , to name a few.\nOver time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.\nWe created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that development and support of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.\nWhy a non-profit? # It may sound strange to create a non-profit initiative when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:\nResearch and educational communities, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source. Researchers and educators who need development, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that offers development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud. Open source communities, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy. Cloud providers, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure. Supporters of open source who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission. As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.\nWhat are we going to do? # With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here’s a rough picture:\nOffer hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure . These will be entirely open source and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They’ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see the 2i2c Right to Replicate document .\nProvide collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education . Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community’s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.\nProvide core development and community support for open source projects that we use. While many organizations use Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they give back to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.\nNext steps # 2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months.

Below is a table describing how the Right to Replicate fits into 2i2c hub technology.\n(Definitions of MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY, etc are defined in RFC 2119 )\nUser Code and Data May be Open Source We encourage adopting and producing open source code and data, but this is up to the user. e.g., licenses for user content/code User Environment Should be Open Source Strong preference for open source tools only, although in some cases user needs may override this. e.g., Python, R, PyData stack. 2i2c Infrastructure Must be Open Source Strong commitment to using only open source software. e.g., JupyterHub, Kubernetes, Postgresql Cloud Provider Infrastructure Must be Portable See this blog post for more information. Below we describe our commitments in our own infrastructure stack in more detail.\nHow 2i2c infrastructure ensures this right # 2i2c infrastructure and documentation for it MUST BE as transparent \u0026amp; accessible as possible, so communities can replicate our configuration without having to extract any ‘secret sauce’ from 2i2c. If they choose to, they can also inspect, audit \u0026amp; modify the infrastructure they are paying for and using.\nTo ensure the Right to Replicate to our communities, 2i2c makes the following commitments to infrastructure we build and operate:\nWe MUST use only open source software to run our infrastructure. By only using software that is available to everyone on the same terms, we can ensure that communities can replicate the infrastructure without having to negotiate licensing terms with proprietary software vendors. In addition, any changes we make to open source software will be made in public and/or contributed upstream, so communities continue to have access to them regardless of where their infrastructure is.\nWe MUST NOT directly depend on proprietary cloud vendor specific products or APIs. Instead, we use cloud-managed open source software, or hide the dependency behind a layer of abstraction. This ensures that communities can port their infrastructure to any cloud provider of their choice, or run it on their own hardware with purely open source software.\nThis set of commitments acts as a business continuity plan for our partner communities, ensuring 2i2c will follow best practices within the open source, open education and open research ecosystems.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144e3,"objectID":"f9d84027023bd7709772a71806b3aca9","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/right-to-replicate/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/right-to-replicate/","section":"","summary":"The Right to Replicate gives communities the right to replicate their infrastructure in its entirety elsewhere, with or without 2i2c.\nThis document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a community’s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c.","tags":null,"title":"The Community Right to Replicate","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"0683f5804634b3020a9e3219fd1f3789","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/service/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/service/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"2i2c managed JupyterHubs","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"2i2c has expertise in cloud infrastructure and managed services for interactive computing in research and education workflows.

We are exploring sustainability and services models around this goal, and invite feedback and ideas for ways that we can improve this service. We are running JupyterHubs for many communities already, and are accepting new communities in batches as our capacity grows. If you are interested in having a managed JupyterHub for your community, check out our cloud service page for more information or send an email to partnerships@2i2c.org to discuss.\nPitch a project or grant # Our team is always looking our for opportunities to collaborate and learn from others in order to have an impact. Sometimes these can even lead to new grant ideas or ongoing projects. If you have an idea for collaboration that is aligned with our mission, and that would benefit from our skills and perspective, please send an email to partnerships@2i2c.org and we can discuss.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"5fff794d732d0d9048992165a6c484a4","permalink":"https://2i2c.org/collaborate/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/collaborate/","section":"","summary":"2i2c has expertise in cloud infrastructure and managed services for interactive computing in research and education workflows.
