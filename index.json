In that time we\u0026rsquo;ve made progress along several directions, and wish to use this blog post to provide updates about the ways in which 2i2c has evolved over the first months of its existence.\nBelow are a few major updates from the 2i2c community - as always, if you want to learn more about 2i2c, keep an eye on our blog or subscribe to the 2i2c mailing list.\nEarly pilot JupyterHub infrastructure First off - we have been making progress building out our JupyterHub deployment infrastructure for 2i2c. One of our major organizational goals is to build a sustainable service managing open source cloud infrastructure for interactive computing. This service will provide hosted, customized JupyterHubs for communities of practice in research and education. They\u0026rsquo;ll be built entirely with open source tools that are community-driven, and that respect the customer\u0026rsquo;s Right to Replicate.\nIn order to accomplish this, 2i2c is running several pilots with partners and interested organizations, supported by our funding from CZI, as well as from the JROST rapid response fund. These pilots are meant to be learning opportunities to understand what kind of infrastructure and service it needs to build moving forward.\nThe documentation for our pilot hubs infrastructure contains information about our deployments and infrastructure. It is served from this 2i2c-org/pilot-hubs repository, a centralized location for configuring and deploying a federated network of JupyterHubs. Each JupyterHub is independent of one another, and could be spun out from the centralized repository with minimal extra work, giving hub users the ability to replicate their infrastructure, with or without 2i2c. We will continue refining the code in this repository as we learn more from our hub infrastructure pilots.\nJupyterHub for geospatial analytics - A collaboration with Pangeo As originally announced on the Pangeo blog, 2i2c is forging a collaboration with the Pangeo project around operating and developing cloud infrastructure for large-scale geospatial analytics! This collaboration is funded through a grant from the Moore Foundation (via Pangeo investigator Ryan Abernathey).\nOver the coming months, 2i2c plans to assume operation of infrastructure underlying the Pangeo project, allowing the Pangeo team to focus their efforts on their core scientific and development missions. Because Pangeo\u0026rsquo;s infrastructure is already running on a fully open source stack with JupyterHub, our first step will simply be to shift control over this infrastructure to 2i2c engineers. We don\u0026rsquo;t anticipate needing to make major changes to their infrastructure and deployments (part of the benefits of using open, modular tools).\nOnce this is complete, we\u0026rsquo;ll next shift our attention to some new areas of development that support use-cases in the Pangeo community (and in the scientific community more broadly). There\u0026rsquo;s a lot of progress that we imagine making - such as supporting publishing pipelines via the Pangeo Gallery or improving tools for scalable computing with Dask Gateway. We\u0026rsquo;ll provide updates as we formally begin this collaboration and hash out a plan for our next steps.\nJupyterHub for education - A collaboration with CloudBank and UC Berkeley In addition, we\u0026rsquo;ve begun a partnership with the UC Berkeley Data Science in Undergraduate Studies program, as well as CloudBank. This collaboration aims to provide hosted JupyterHub infrastructure for community colleges across the state of California. It is an attempt at providing vendor-agnostic and open-source infrastructure to several institutions who would otherwise not be able to deploy this infrastructure on their own.\n2i2c will provide the deployment and configuration architecture for this collaboration, working with Sean Morris in operating this educational infrastructure. All of the cloud infrastructure for this pilot will be funded via CloudBank. We will begin by offering environments that are modeled after the Data 8 course at UC Berkeley. This is part of an effort to build a community of practice around Data Science education using open source tools.\nNew team members We\u0026rsquo;ve also welcomed two new members to the 2i2c core team! 🎉\nThese individuals will both work towards 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s major projects, and collaborate together on running our 2i2c Pilot Hub infrastructure. Here\u0026rsquo;s a bit about each new team member.\n Damián Avila. Damián has been a Jupyter core team member for many years now, and has done work across many different parts of the PyData stack (in particular, Jupyter, Bokeh, RISE, and Nikola). Damián will focus his efforts on supporting JupyterHub infrastructure for the Pangeo project, as well as development across the Executable Books Project Sarah Gibson. Sarah will join 2i2c in June, after spending several years as a Research Software Engineer at the Turing Institute. She has also been involved with the Turing Way for many years. Sarah will focus her efforts on JupyterHub development and operations for the Pangeo community.  Governance and a code of conduct Finally, while it\u0026rsquo;s easy to get lost in technology and collaborations, 2i2c has also made important steps towards defining a stable and transparent organizational model moving forward. 2i2c now has a Steering Council and an early organizational structure. In addition, we\u0026rsquo;ve defined a one-year bootstrap strategy that we\u0026rsquo;ll use to guide our path in the first year of 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s existence.\nFinally, one of the first acts of the Steering Council has been to adopt a Code of Conduct. This is a set of guidelines, and a process for resolving incidents, that makes our community more inclusive, equitable, and enjoyable for all. Creating a Code of Conduct is a crucial part of defining our organizational and community culture, and we\u0026rsquo;re excited to have some explicit guidelines to support our interactions in the future!\nKeep in touch Now that we are improving our organizational foundation, we will try to post more frequent updates and discussions about what we are up to. We hope for 2i2c to be a model organization in participatory, collaborative, transparent operations, and we look forward to working with you all in the future on this journey.\n","date":1621900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1621900800,"objectID":"aaa9d8607a9ab55b6609dfb7578ca344","permalink":"/posts/2021/six-month-update/","publishdate":"2021-05-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/six-month-update/","section":"posts","summary":"It has been about six months since 2i2c first began operations (after receiving funding from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative).

Today we are thrilled to announce that 2i2c has received core support from the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative. You can find CZI\u0026rsquo;s announcement here.\nThis funding totals around $1.4m over three years. It provides crucial core support for 2i2c as it bootstraps itself into existence. We are so thankful to CZI for this support. 🎉🙏✨\nThe rest of this post is a short run-down of what we\u0026rsquo;ll use this funding for, and what we hope to accomplish.\nThe big picture In recent years, several projects including Binder, Pangeo, Syzygy, and the Berkeley DataHubs have built atop the Jupyter architecture to support cloud-based infrastructure for reproducible research, large-scale scientific data analysis, national-scale infrastructure for researchers, and broad-impact educational programs based on freely available computational materials. These projects illustrate the transformative potential of the open Jupyter architecture, but they have also shown that unlocking this potential in service of scientists and educators requires continued development and resources beyond those of open source volunteers.\nIn order to deploy these resources at scale, manage and maintain them for large communities, and to continue developing the underlying technologies for scientific use cases, we need models to sustainably deploy and improve Jupyter technology. We also need capacity for thinking strategically and forging new partnerships to accomplish this goal. This funding will support 2i2c’s early strategic planning and partnership efforts, as well as technical development and operation of Jupyter infrastructure for research and education.\nBelow are two keys goals for this grant:\nGoal 1: Build capacity for Jupyter in research and education The primary goal of this funding is to build more capacity for Jupyter\u0026rsquo;s engagement in research and education. This funding will primarily support Chris Holdgraf to build strategic partnerships and collaborations, find opportunities for Jupyter infrastructure to benefit research and education, coordinate activity in the Jupyter project that benefits these communities, and secure more funding for development, maintenance, and support for Jupyter technology.\nWe are grateful to CZI for this funding because strategy, leadership, and community support are often difficult to fund from grants that are focused on technical deliverables. By funding strategic growth and capacity building, CZI is helping 2i2c lay a strong foundation from which it can have a greater impact.\nGoal 2: Support hosted Jupyter infrastructure for research and education 2i2c will offer hosted interactive computing infrastructure utilizing the Jupyter ecosystem. It will both deploy and operate this infrastructure for researchers and educators, as well as perform core development to ensure that it serves these communities well. Funding from this grant will support 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s first hire - Georgiana Dolocan as an Open Source Infrastructure Engineer. Georgiana has been the JupyterHub Contributor in Residence for the past year, and we are so excited for her to join 2i2c!\nGeorgiana will begin by supporting several pilot hubs that are run by 2i2c for community colleges, universities, and research institutions. She will help these organizations accomplish their mission through 2i2c infrastructure, and will develop these technologies so they are stable, scalable, and serve a diverse set of needs in research and education. This will hopefully set the foundation for 2i2c to sustainably offer this hub infrastructure to a wider audience in the future.\nThis is the next step in Georgiana’s journey through the Jupyter ecosystem that began with an outreachy internship followed by a term as Contributor in Residence. Both of these steps were made possible thanks to Jupyter stakeholders who invest their resources, time, and mentorship to grow Jupyter’s community beyond the people that have traditionally been involved in the project. It’s also possible because of funders committing resources to broaden participation and inclusion - in particular, the Berkeley Institute for Data Science and NumFOCUS for their original support of our Outreachy interns and the CZI EOSS grant series for funding the original Contributor in Residence.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s next With this core support, 2i2c turns towards its JupyterHub pilot deployments to build early prototypes that serve research and education, and to build organizational models that sustain these hubs and their development. If you or your organization think you’d be a good fit for these pilots, please reach out to 2i2c and let us know!\nMany thanks again to CZI for this support - we believe that it is an excellent investment in the Jupyter community and in open source communities more generally. We also believe it will lead to major advancements in supporting interactive computing workflows for research and education. We look forward to what the next three years will bring!\n","date":1605744e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1605744e3,"objectID":"011390bc3a97740cd41789ab12ff32e9","permalink":"/posts/2021/czi-core-support/","publishdate":"2020-11-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/posts/2021/czi-core-support/","section":"posts","summary":"Last week we announced the creation of 2i2c, a non-profit initiative dedicated to improving and facilitating access to infrastructure for interactive computing workflows in research and education.

It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.\nThis is a short post about why we created 2i2c, what we hope that it will do, and what we are up to next. If you\u0026rsquo;d prefer to watch a video instead of read a blog post, check out this talk about 2i2c at JupyterCon 2020:\n  Why create 2i2c? The founding team of 2i2c has spent the last several years running projects that use interactive computing for research and education, including bringing data science education to thousands of students, connecting geospatial researchers with large datasets and computational resources in the cloud, and providing federated online environment hubs to schools across Canada, to name a few.\nOver time we realized that, while infrastructure for interactive computing could be a huge benefit to research and education, it also required a fair amount of expertise to configure, deploy, and develop. We wished for other organizations to enjoy the same success that we had found, but learned that for many, deploying their own infrastructure was a non-starter to adoption. Instead, many were turning to proprietary or vendor-specific tooling.\nWe created 2i2c so that these organizations can use entirely open-source tools without hiring and training their own dev-ops and infrastructure talent, and so that development and support of open tools for interactive computing continues to represent the interests of research and education.\nWhy a non-profit? It may sound strange to create a non-profit initiative when there are many VC-funded startups and large tech companies offering notebook services these days. However, we think that a non-profit organization is the right approach to balance the interests of all the stakeholders that we wish to serve. We hope that 2i2c will be a partner to:\n Research and educational communities, who can rely on 2i2c to provide them cutting-edge infrastructure for interactive computing that is 💯 open source. Researchers and educators who need development, who can rely on 2i2c as a collaborator that offers development and expertise in open-source infrastructure to push the cutting edge of interactive computing in the cloud. Open source communities, who can count on 2i2c support and grow the communities that underlie the tools that we deploy. Cloud providers, who wish to help the research and educational community via their infrastructure. Supporters of open source who wish to support interactive computing for research and education via a non-profit dedicated to exactly this mission.  As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c is dedicated to supporting an ecosystem of tools and stakeholders across the open source community, and to ensuring that those tools are well-suited for research and education. We believe strongly in mission-driven work, and non-profit status will ensure that the work that we do is always aligned with our mission and values.\nWhat are we going to do? With all of that in mind, what is 2i2c actually going to do? We are still working out the details, but here\u0026rsquo;s a rough picture:\nOffer hosted interactive computing environments on cloud infrastructure. These will be entirely open source and vendor-neutral, and customizable for the communities that are using them. They\u0026rsquo;ll be offered either as a fee-for-service model and/or subsidized through grants and donations. We wish to build upon the success of JupyterHub as a gateway to computational resources and environments, learning environments, and communities of users. For more information about the vision and values of our hosted infrastructure, see the 2i2c Right to Replicate document.\nProvide collaboration and development for interactive computing in research and education. Beyond providing hub infrastructure, there are many ways in which solving problems in research and education can lead to better tools, infrastructure, and workflows in the open source community. For example - how can we generalize a community\u0026rsquo;s solution to scalable computing so that it can be useful for other use-cases as well? We hope that 2i2c can be an aggregator and integrator of many perspectives in research and education, and build tools that are maximally useful across communities.\nProvide core development and community support for open source projects that we use. While many organizations use Jupyter technology in their projects, it is also crucial that they give back to those tools in order to keep the ecosystem healthy. As a mission-driven non-profit, 2i2c has a core goal in not only deploying and customizing open source tools, but also providing core support for them.\nNext steps 2i2c is a young organization, but we already have a few exciting ideas to work towards in the coming months. Here\u0026rsquo;s an idea of what we\u0026rsquo;ll be up to next.\nOur first step is to understand how interactive computing can best-serve the research and education communities. We know that interactive computing tools work in our specific use-cases, but how do these generalize to other domains or types of organizations? Moreover, how can we improve the open source tools to make them even more customizable for each community?\nWe\u0026rsquo;ll begin answering this question through several focused JupyterHub pilots aimed at different use-cases across research and education:\n A \u0026ldquo;Hubs for All\u0026rdquo; pilot for education. This will focus on making standard educational environments via JupyterHub accessible to a broad range of educational institutions, in particular, traditionally under-resourced institutions such as community colleges, state colleges, and HBCUs. Research-focused hubs for earth analytics. Research requires more complex and customized infrastructure than education, and so we are piloting hub infrastructure for a few specific research communities to understand how we can meet their needs. We will use this to better-understand how 2i2c and support a diverse research community in the future. JupyterHub development for the Pangeo Project. Pangeo has been a collaborator of 2i2c since day one, and we love its vision for large-scale earth analytics via cloud infrastructure. We plan to work closely with Pangeo leadership to work on early development of tools aimed at facilitating scalable computing for research on Pangeo infrastructure. More information about this to come soon.  We\u0026rsquo;ll also use these pilots to develop an organizational sustainability model around this infrastructure. It takes expertise to manage and develop cloud infrastructure, and 2i2c wishes to pay market rates for its engineers. How can 2i2c offer services and development in a way that is sustainable both for itself and for other institutions? We\u0026rsquo;ll use these pilots to create a plan for both sustaining and scaling 2i2c\u0026rsquo;s ability to serve institutions and teams.\nWhat do we need? As a non-profit initiative, 2i2c has a long road ahead of it. We cannot take venture capital funding, so we have to raise funds the old-fashioned way.

It is a non-profit dedicated to making open tools for interactive computing more accessible and more powerful for the research and education communities.","tags":["meta"],"title":"Hello World","type":"posts"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Right to Replicate gives customers the right to replicate their infrastructure in its entirety elsewhere, with or without 2i2c.\nThis document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a customer’s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c. We make these commitments because we believe that using infrastructure that follows these principles will lead to a more fair, just, equitable world. We also believe they are the right foundation for more productive and impactful research and education.\n2i2c is committed to running its own infrastructure on open-source tools and vendor-agnostic infrastructure, though it does not force users to use only open-source tools in their own environments, code, and data. Below is a table describing how the Right to Replicate fits into 2i2c hub technology.\n(Definitions of MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY, etc are defined in RFC 2119)\n          User Code and Data May be Open Source We encourage adopting and producing open source code and data, but this is up to the user. e.g., licenses for user content/code   User Environment Should be Open Source Strong preference for open source tools only, although in some cases user needs may override this. e.g., Python, R, PyData stack.   2i2c Infrastructure Must be Open Source Strong commitment to using only open source software. e.g., JupyterHub, Kubernetes, Postgresql   Cloud Provider Infrastructure Must be Portable See this blog post for more information.     Below we describe our commitments in our own infrastructure stack in more detail.\nHow 2i2c infrastructure ensures this right 2i2c infrastructure and documentation for it MUST BE as transparent \u0026amp; accessible as possible, so customers can replicate our configuration without having to extract any ‘secret sauce’ from 2i2c. If they choose to, they can also inspect, audit \u0026amp; modify the infrastructure they are paying for and using.\nTo ensure the Right to Replicate to our customers, 2i2c makes the following commitments to infrastructure we build and operate:\n  We MUST use only open source software to run our infrastructure. By only using software that is available to everyone on the same terms, we can ensure that customers can replicate the infrastructure without having to negotiate licensing terms with proprietary software vendors. In addition, any changes we make to open source software will be made in public and/or contributed upstream, so customers continue to have access to them regardless of where their infrastructure is.\n  We MUST NOT directly depend on proprietary cloud vendor specific products or APIs. Instead, we use cloud-managed open source software, or hide the dependency behind a layer of abstraction. This ensures that customers can port their infrastructure to any cloud provider of their choice, or run it on their own hardware with purely open source software.\n  This set of commitments acts as a business continuity plan for our customers, ensuring 2i2c will follow best practices within the open source, open education and open research ecosystems.\n","date":1530144e3,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530144e3,"objectID":"f9d84027023bd7709772a71806b3aca9","permalink":"/right-to-replicate/","publishdate":"2018-06-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/right-to-replicate/","section":"","summary":"The Right to Replicate gives customers the right to replicate their infrastructure in its entirety elsewhere, with or without 2i2c.\nThis document describes 2i2c’s commitment to a customer’s “right to replicate”, and how this translates into specific infrastructure commitments from 2i2c.","tags":null,"title":"The Customer Right to Replicate","type":"page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"20859a8e1c2853c8a9f7398180a74c24","permalink":"/infrastructure/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/infrastructure/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"2i2c managed JupyterHubs","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"About 2i2c","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Open positions Below is a list of open positions at 2i2c. To be notified of any open positions, sign up for our mailing list.\n We are not currently hiring for any positions, but keep an eye here as we are a young organization and hope to expand soon!   Open Source Infrastructure Engineer: Pangeo Project  Dev-ops and infrastructure work Open source data workflows, pipelines, and environments Focus on Pangeo community and geospatial analytics  Salary: $110,000 - 130,000\nFully remote\n Details and Apply    -- Why 2i2c? 2i2c believes that open infrastructure is a crucial part of transforming research and education to be more powerful, more equitable, more inclusive, and more accessible. We are a small and growing team, and recognize that our early employees play a crucial role in setting the right culture and direction for the organization.\nHere are a few reasons that we think 2i2c is a fantastic team to work with.\nOur values and our mission drive our actions 🧭 2i2c believes in weaving our set of core values into everything that we do, and that this will guide 2i2c in being as impactful as possible. As a member of 2i2c’s team, you’ll have an opportunity to participate in a community that believes in these values, and tries to make the world a better place through living them every day.\nWe have great team culture 🙌 2i2c draws from experience in many large open source communities over the years. Because these communities operate fully remotely and strive to be as inclusive and participatory as possible, they must also strive to be more transparent and systematic in how they communicate, share information, and work. We are building a culture at 2i2c that follows these principles and builds upon them.\nWe have competitive pay and great benefits 📊 2i2c believes that it\u0026rsquo;s important for non-profit work to pay competitively with the tech industry. See more information on our salaries and compensation. We are also a remote-first organization with team practices that can be spread across the world.\nWe support research and education 🔬 All of the work we do at 2i2c feeds into our mission: to support research and education through interactive computing infrastructure. Being a part of the 2i2c team means that each day you will spend your time building, operating, and supporting the infrastructure that powers data-driven discovery and learning.\nOpen source communities are in our DNA 🤝 All of the technical development that we do is open source, usually in partnership with other open source communities rather than controlled entirely by 2i2c. This means that the work you do with 2i2c will benefit a much broader community, and you’ll be encouraged to connect with other open source communities as you do your work.\nSalaries and benefits We pay competitive salaries for all of our employees at SF market rates. 2i2c chooses its salary levels based on job title and discrete levels that correspond to experience. These salaries are fixed and consistent across all employees of 2i2c \u0026ndash; we do not pay different amounts based on geographic location or cost-of-living, you will be paid the same regardless of where you live. 2i2c also offers a generous benefits package, or will provide extra compensation if you are not in a position to take advantage of US-based benefits packages.\nWhy approach salaries in this way? For a few reasons. First, we don’t believe that people should have to take a large pay-cut just to work at a non-profit organization, and we want to hire competitively for the tech industry. Second, we believe in equal pay for equal work. We don’t believe that your ability to help 2i2c accomplish its mission is impacted by your ability to negotiate a better salary. We also don’t think it is impacted by external factors like your geographical location or cost of living. Third, we believe in transparency and openness when it comes to our salaries, in order to balance the amount of information on both sides of the hiring equation. We think that these practices allow 2i2c to hire competitively, equitably, and successfully.\nOur benefits RETIREMENT We have established a qualified, defined contribution retirement plan. We make monthly plan contributions on behalf of each participant equal to 10% or 3% of the eligible employee’s monthly compensation, depending on the employee\u0026rsquo;s appointment type. Most employee types qualify for the 10% contribution. Contributions are fully vested and are not dependent upon the employee making contributions on their own, ie, this is not an employer \u0026ldquo;match\u0026rdquo;.\nPAID TIME OFF: Vacation, Sick, and Holiday leave We offer generous vacation and sick leave accrual. We observe 9 holidays throughout the year plus Thanksgiving and a 2-week paid Winter Break holiday during the last two weeks of December.\nHEALTH: Medical, Dental, and Vision We offer excellent medical options and coverage. Employees may choose from three medical plans (two HMOs, one PPO). Our dental and vision plans are comprehensive and accepted widely by dental and vision care providers. We full cover the cost of plan premiums.\nWe also provide Life and Long-Term Disability Insurance, and employees may opt to participate in our Tax-deferred Annuity Plan and Flexible Spending Account as a way to set aside pre-tax dollars to pay for long term savings, medical or dependent care.\nWhere applicable, if you are located outside of the United States, we will work with you to get similar benefits according to your geographical context.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"3f1a2c5f26bd71ce7094519646e3cd03","permalink":"/careers/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/careers/","section":"","summary":"Open positions Below is a list of open positions at 2i2c.
